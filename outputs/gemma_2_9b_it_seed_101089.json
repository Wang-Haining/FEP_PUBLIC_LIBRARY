It's great that you're taking steps to protect yourself.  \n\nI can definitely give you some general tips, but remember, I can't provide specific advice about your bank's system since I don't have access to that information. \n\nHere are some key things to keep in mind for safe online banking:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique and Complex:** Use a different password for your online banking than any other account.  Make it a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. \n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.\n\n**2. Secure Connections:**\n\n* **https:** Always make sure the website address starts with \"https://\" and has a padlock icon in the address bar. This indicates a secure connection.\n* **Public Wi-Fi:** Avoid banking on public Wi-Fi networks as they are often less secure.\n\n**3. Beware of Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails/Texts:**  Be very cautious of emails or texts asking for your login information or account details.  Legitimate banks will never ask for this information this way.\n* **Hover Over Links:** Before clicking on any links in an email or text, hover your mouse over them to see the actual URL. If it looks suspicious, don't click it.\n\n**4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**\n\n* **Extra Security Layer:** Enable MFA whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**5. Monitor Your Accounts:**\n\n* **Regularly Review:** Check your bank statements and online account activity regularly for any suspicious transactions.\n\n**6. Contact Your Bank:**\n\n* **Questions or Concerns:** If you have any questions or concerns about online banking security, don't hesitate to contact your bank directly. They can provide specific guidance and support.\n\n\nI hope this helps, Hailie! Remember, your bank's website will have detailed information about their security measures and practices. Don't hesitate to reach out to them directly if you have any specific questions.\n\n\nDo you have any other questions I can help you with today?",

That's a really important issue these days. \n\nI can definitely help you with some tips. \n\nLet's start with some basics:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Variety is Key:** Use a unique, strong password for every online account.  Don't reuse passwords! \n* **Mix it Up:**  A strong password should have a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Think of a memorable phrase and use the first letter of each word, then add numbers and symbols.\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate strong passwords for you.\n\n**2. Be Cautious About Sharing Information:**\n\n* **Think Before You Post:**  Be mindful of what personal information you share on social media or online forums.\n* **Limit Public Data:** Review your privacy settings on social media and other websites. Make sure you're not sharing more information than you're comfortable with publicly.\n* **Be Wary of Phishing:**  Be careful about clicking on links in emails or messages from unknown senders. Phishing scams try to trick you into revealing personal information.\n\n**3. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your operating system, apps, and browsers up to date. Updates often include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities.\n* **Firewall:** Make sure your computer or mobile device has a firewall enabled.\n* **Antivirus Software:** Use reliable antivirus software to protect against malware and viruses.\n\n**4. Public Wi-Fi:**\n\n* **Use a VPN:**  If you use public Wi-Fi, it's a good idea to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, making it more secure.\n\n**5. Two-Factor Authentication:**\n\n* **Extra Layer of Security:** Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.\n\n **Resources:**\n\n* **Online Privacy Tips from the FTC:** [https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-protect-yourself-online](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-protect-yourself-online)\n* **Privacy Guides from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF):** [https://www.eff.org/privacy](https://www.eff.org/privacy)\n\nRemember, protecting your privacy is an ongoing process. Stay informed about new threats and best practices.\n\n\nI hope these tips are helpful, Harry. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help!",

I can definitely help you with that. \n\nBased on your preferences, I have a few suggestions that might resonate:\n\n**Classics:**\n\n* **\"Middlemarch\" by George Eliot:** This sprawling novel delves into the lives of interconnected characters in a provincial English town during the 19th century. It's a masterpiece of character development and social commentary, exploring themes of love, ambition, morality, and the search for meaning. \n\n* **\"Anna Karenina\" by Leo Tolstoy:**  This tragic love story set in 19th-century Russia is a profound exploration of marriage, societal expectations, and the consequences of passion. Tolstoy's prose is beautiful and lyrical, and the characters are incredibly complex and well-drawn.\n\n**Contemporary:**\n\n* **\"The Magus\" by John Fowles:**  A mind-bending novel about a young Englishman who gets caught up in a mysterious game orchestrated by a wealthy recluse on a Greek island.  It's a journey into the nature of reality, identity, and manipulation, with beautiful prose and a haunting atmosphere.\n* **\"A Suitable Boy\" by Vikram Seth:** This epic novel follows the lives of four families in post-independence India. It's a sweeping portrait of a changing society, filled with richly drawn characters, intricate relationships, and a lyrical, almost poetic writing style.\n\n**Bonus:**\n\n* **\"The Remains of the Day\" by Kazuo Ishiguro:**  A poignant novel told from the perspective of an aging butler reflecting on his life of service in a grand English estate. It's a quiet, contemplative story about memory, regret, and the choices we make.\n\n\nI encourage you to explore these authors and see which titles resonate with you.

It's richly written, atmospheric, and suspenseful.\n* **\"The Haunting of Hill House\" by Shirley Jackson:** This classic ghost story is a masterclass in building suspense and creating a deeply unsettling atmosphere.\n* **\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\" by Shirley Jackson:** Another masterpiece by Jackson, this novel features two sisters living in isolation in a decaying mansion after a family tragedy.\n* **\"Beloved\" by Toni Morrison:** This Pulitzer Prize-winning novel explores the legacy of slavery and its impact on a family in post-Civil War Ohio.

    "response": "Hi Henry, thanks for coming in! I understand you're concerned about online privacy, and that's completely understandable. It's important to protect yourself in the digital world. \n\nLet's break down some steps you can take to improve your online privacy:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Use a different, strong password for each of your online accounts. A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. \n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to help you create and store strong, unique passwords. There are free and paid options available.\n\n**2. Be Cautious About What You Share:**\n\n* **Think Before You Post:**  Be mindful of what personal information you share on social media and online forums. Avoid posting your full address, phone number, birthdate, or other sensitive details publicly.\n* **Privacy Settings:** Review the privacy settings on your social media accounts and adjust them to control who can see your posts and information.\n\n**3. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your operating system, apps, and browsers updated. Updates often include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities.\n* **Antivirus Protection:** Install reputable antivirus and anti-malware software on your computer and mobile devices.\n* **Public Wi-Fi:** Be cautious when using public Wi-Fi. Consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic.\n\n**4. Phishing Awareness:**\n\n* **Be Wary of Suspicious Emails and Links:**  Don't click on links or open attachments in emails from unknown senders. Be skeptical of emails that ask for personal information or urge you to act quickly.\n\n**5. Two-Factor Authentication:**\n\n* **Enable 2FA:** Whenever possible, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* **Digital Literacy Classes:** The library offers free classes on digital literacy, including online safety and privacy. Check our schedule or ask me for more information.\n* **Online Resources:** We have access to online resources like privacy guides and tutorials. I can help you find what you need.\n\nRemember, protecting your privacy online is an ongoing process. Stay informed about new threats and best practices.\n\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with today, Henry?",

I can't give specific advice on your bank's particular website or app, as I don't have access to that information. However, I can share some general tips to help you stay safe while banking online:\n\n**1. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Strong Passwords:** Use a unique, strong password for your online banking, different from any other accounts you have.\n\n    *  A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n\n* **Update Software:** Keep your computer, phone, and browser software updated with the latest security patches.\n\n* **Beware of Public Wi-Fi:**\n\n    * Avoid accessing your online banking on public Wi-Fi networks unless you're using a secure virtual private network (VPN).\n\n**2. Protect Your Login Information:**\n\n* **Never share your username or password with anyone.** Your bank will never ask for this information via email or phone.\n* **Enable Two-Factor Authentication:**\n\n    * Most banks offer two-factor authentication (2FA), which adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n* **Log Out Properly:** Always log out of your online banking session when you're finished.\n\n**3. Be Cautious of Phishing Attempts:**\n\n* **Don't click on links in suspicious emails or text messages.**\n\n    *  Hover over links to see the actual URL before clicking.\n* **Be wary of emails or messages that seem too good to be true.**\n\n**4. Monitor Your Accounts:**\n\n* **Review your account statements regularly for any unauthorized transactions.**\n\n* **Set up alerts for unusual activity.**\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **Your Bank's Website:** Your bank's website should have a dedicated security section with helpful tips and information.\n* **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):** The CFPB offers resources on online banking safety at [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/).\n* **Federal Trade Commission (FTC):** The FTC has information on avoiding scams and identity theft at [https://www.identitytheft.gov/](https://www.identitytheft.gov/).\n\nRemember, if you suspect any fraudulent activity, contact your bank immediately.\n\n\nI hope this helps, John!

While the characters are complex and flawed, their archetypal motivations (like the thirst for knowledge, the allure of the forbidden, and the weight of guilt) make them relatable. Tartt's writing is beautiful and atmospheric, building suspense slowly and masterfully.\n\n**2. *We Have Always Lived in the Castle* by Shirley Jackson:** This gothic suspense novel features two sisters living in isolation after a family tragedy. Their world is both eerie and compelling, and Jackson's prose is sparse yet haunting. The characters, while somewhat archetypal (the reclusive sisters, the nosy outsider), are deeply human and their choices are both understandable and unsettling.\n\n**3. *Rebecca* by Daphne du Maurier:** This classic thriller centers on a young woman who marries a wealthy widower and moves into his imposing mansion, Manderley. The shadow of his deceased wife, Rebecca, looms large over the story, creating a sense of mystery and dread. The writing is elegant and evocative, and the characters, though not entirely unique, are well-drawn and psychologically intriguing.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Check out our library's online catalog:** We have a vast collection of books, and you can filter by genre, reading level, and other criteria.\n\n* **Ask a librarian for recommendations:** We are always happy to help you find the perfect book!\n\n* **Consider borrowing audiobooks:** If you prefer to listen to books, we have a wide selection of audiobooks available.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.

It follows two sisters who are witches living in a quirky seaside town.  The story is full of magic, family secrets, and heartwarming moments. \n\nAnother author to explore is **Hanya Yanagihara**. Her novels are known for their layered narratives and complex characters, but they also have a deeply human and relatable quality. \n\n**\"A Little Life\"** is a challenging but ultimately rewarding read. It follows the lives of four friends in New York City, and explores themes of friendship, love, trauma, and redemption.  \n\nIf you're open to something a bit more lighthearted, you might enjoy **\"The House in the Cerulean Sea\" by T.J. Klune**. It's a charming and heartwarming story about a social worker who visits an orphanage for magical children. \n\nI can also suggest some books based on specific themes or genres you're interested in.

    "response": "It's great that you're taking steps to protect your privacy online, Camron. It's more important than ever in today's digital world.  I can definitely offer some guidance. \n\nThink of it like protecting your home security: you lock your doors and windows, and you're careful who you let in. Online privacy is similar. Here are some key steps:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords and Two-Factor Authentication:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:** Use a unique, strong password for each online account. A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. \n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to store your passwords securely. This way, you don't have to remember them all. Popular options include LastPass, 1Password, and Bitwarden.\n* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enable 2FA whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**2. Be Careful What You Share:**\n\n* **Think Before You Post:**  Be mindful of what personal information you share on social media. Avoid posting your full address, phone number, or other sensitive details.\n* **Privacy Settings:** Review the privacy settings on your social media accounts and adjust them to limit who can see your posts and information.\n\n**3. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your operating system, apps, and antivirus software up to date. Updates often include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities.\n* **Firewall:** Make sure your computer or mobile device has a firewall enabled. This helps block unauthorized access to your device.\n\n**4. Be Aware of Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails:** Be cautious of emails from unknown senders, especially those asking for personal information. Don't click on links or attachments unless you're sure they're safe.\n* **Phishing Scams:**  Phishing scams try to trick you into giving away your login credentials. Be wary of messages that seem too good to be true or create a sense of urgency.\n\n**5. Use a VPN:**\n\n* **Virtual Private Network (VPN):** A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, making it more difficult for others to track your online activity. This is especially helpful when using public Wi-Fi.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n* **Federal Trade Commission (FTC):** [https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/)\n* **National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA):** [https://staysafeonline.org/](https://staysafeonline.org/)\n* **Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF):** [https://www.eff.org/](https://www.eff.org/)\n\nRemember, protecting your privacy online is an ongoing process.

    "response": "That's an interesting combination!  \n\nSince you're looking for a book that's both fast-paced and thought-provoking, with simple characters and literary writing, I'd recommend exploring these genres:\n\n**1. Science Fiction with Philosophical Themes:**\n\n* **\"The Martian\" by Andy Weir:** This book is a thrilling survival story with a witty protagonist and a focus on scientific problem-solving. It explores themes of human resilience, ingenuity, and the human need for connection.\n* **\"Blindsight\" by Peter Watts:**  A hard sci-fi novel that delves into consciousness, perception, and the nature of intelligence. While the story is fast-paced and action-packed, it also raises profound philosophical questions about what it means to be human.\n\n**2. Dystopian Fiction:**\n\n* **\"The Handmaid's Tale\" by Margaret Atwood:** A chillingly relevant novel about a totalitarian society that controls women's bodies. It's a quick read with powerful imagery and characters that stay with you long after you finish.\n* **\"Fahrenheit 451\" by Ray Bradbury:** A classic dystopian novel about a future where books are banned and firemen burn them. It explores themes of censorship, conformity, and the importance of individual thought.\n\n**3. Contemporary Fiction:**\n\n* **\"The Road\" by Cormac McCarthy:** A post-apocalyptic novel about a father and son struggling to survive in a desolate world. It's a bleak but beautiful story about love, hope, and the human spirit.\n* **\"The Stranger\" by Albert Camus:** A philosophical novel about a man who is indifferent to the world around him. It explores themes of alienation, absurdity, and the search for meaning in a meaningless world.\n\n**To help me narrow down the choices, could you tell me:**\n\n* **Are there any particular themes or topics you're interested in exploring?** (e.g., technology, social justice, identity)\n* **Do you prefer a specific setting?** (e.g., contemporary, futuristic, historical)\n* **Are there any authors or books you've enjoyed in the past that I could use as a starting point?**\n\n\nI'm here to help you find the perfect book!",

It's a gentle, funny, and ultimately uplifting story about second chances and finding love in unexpected places. \n\n* **\"The House in the Cerulean Sea\" by TJ Klune:** This one is a bit more whimsical, with a charming cast of magical children and a social worker who learns to open his heart. It's a feel-good story about acceptance, found family, and the power of kindness.\n\n* **\"Get a Life, Chloe Brown\" by Talia Hibbert:** This is the first in a charming romantic comedy series featuring a chronically ill woman who decides to take control of her life and make a list of things she wants to experience. It's funny, sexy, and heartwarming, with a great message about self-love and empowerment.\n\nDo any of these sound like they might be up your alley?

This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n* **Beware of Phishing:** Be cautious of emails, texts, or phone calls asking for your personal information. Your bank will never ask for your password or account number via these channels.\n* **Secure Wi-Fi:** Only access your online banking on secure Wi-Fi networks. Avoid public Wi-Fi whenever possible, as it can be less secure.\n* **Keep Software Updated:** Regularly update your computer's operating system and web browser to patch security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Navigating Your Bank's Website:**\n\n* **Directly Access the Site:** Always go to your bank's website by typing the address directly into your browser's address bar, rather than clicking on links in emails or text messages.\n* **Look for Security Indicators:** Ensure the website uses HTTPS (indicated by a padlock icon in the address bar) to encrypt your connection.\n* **Review Transactions Regularly:** Check your online banking account frequently to monitor for any unauthorized activity.\n* **Contact Your Bank:** If you notice anything suspicious or have any questions, don't hesitate to contact your bank directly through their official phone number or website.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n* **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):** https://www.consumerfinance.gov/\n* **Federal Trade Commission (FTC):** https://www.identitytheft.gov/\n\nRemember, your financial security is important. Take these steps to protect yourself online.\n\n\nIf you have any more questions or need help finding specific resources, please don't hesitate to ask.",

Klune:**\n\n* This heartwarming fantasy novel follows a caseworker who investigates a magical orphanage on a remote island. It features a charming cast of characters, a gentle pace, and explores themes of found family and acceptance with lyrical prose.\n\n**2. *Evvie Drake Starts Over* by Linda Holmes:**\n\n* This contemporary romance follows a recently widowed woman who rents a room to a former Major League pitcher struggling to make a comeback. It's a sweet and uplifting story about grief, second chances, and finding love in unexpected places.\n\n**3. *The Midnight Library* by Matt Haig:**\n\n* This thought-provoking novel explores the concept of regret and second chances. It follows a woman who gets to explore different versions of her life through a magical library, ultimately learning about the power of choice and self-acceptance.\n\n**4. *The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society* by Mary Ann Shaffer:**\n\n* Set in post-World War II Guernsey, this novel tells the story of a writer who connects with the members of a unique book club formed during the German occupation. It's a heartwarming tale of community, resilience, and the healing power of literature.\n\n**5. *Little Fires Everywhere* by Celeste Ng:**\n\n* While this novel has a bit more complexity and explores darker themes, it also features strong characters, compelling relationships, and beautiful writing. It's a story about secrets, class, and motherhood that will stay with you long after you finish reading.\n\nBefore you choose, I encourage you to check out our library catalog or browse our shelves.

That's a common concern, and I'm happy to help you navigate it. \n\nIt's great that you're taking steps to protect your financial information.  \n\nLet's talk about some key safety practices:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Each of your online accounts (banking, email, shopping, etc.) should have a unique, strong password.  A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. \n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager. They securely store your passwords and can generate strong, unique ones for you.\n\n**2. Secure Connections:**\n\n* **HTTPS:** Always look for \"https://\" in the web address bar before entering any personal information. The \"s\" stands for secure, meaning your information is encrypted.\n* **Lock Icon:** Look for a padlock icon in the address bar, which also indicates a secure connection.\n\n**3. Be Cautious of Phishing:**\n\n* **Emails and Texts:** Don't click on links in emails or texts from unknown senders, even if they look official.  Always type the bank's website address directly into your browser.\n* **Suspicious Requests:**  Your bank will never ask for your full password or Social Security number via email or text.\n\n**4. Public Wi-Fi:**\n\n* **Avoid Sensitive Transactions:**  Don't do online banking or access sensitive accounts on public Wi-Fi networks unless you're using a VPN (Virtual Private Network). \n\n**5. Device Security:**\n\n* **Updates:** Keep your computer, phone, and tablet software updated. Updates often include security patches.\n* **Antivirus:** Install a reputable antivirus program and keep it up to date.\n* **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Enable multi-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\nWe have a lot of resources to help you learn more about online safety and digital literacy:\n\n* **Computers and Free Wi-Fi:** You can access the internet securely on our computers and use our free Wi-Fi.\n* **Free Workshops:** We offer free workshops on topics like online banking, internet safety, and digital literacy. Check our website or ask a librarian about upcoming events.\n* **Books and Online Databases:** We have a great selection of books and online resources on personal finance and technology.\n\n\nI hope this helps, Sharon!

It's a quiet, meditative novel with minimalist prose and a focus on human connection. \n* **\"Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine\" by Gail Honeyman:** This charming and quirky novel features a socially awkward woman who learns to connect with others and discover the meaning of friendship and love. It's written with a dry wit and a touch of the surreal.\n* **\"Dept. of Speculation\" by Jenny Offill:** This fragmented and experimental novel explores the complexities of marriage, motherhood, and existential angst.  It's a thought-provoking and atmospheric read with a unique narrative structure.\n\n**Classics:**\n\n* **\"The Metamorphosis\" by Franz Kafka:** This short but powerful novella tells the story of a man who wakes up transformed into a giant insect.  It's a classic exploration of alienation and isolation, written in a stark and unforgettable style.\n* **\"The Stranger\" by Albert Camus:** This existentialist novel follows a man who commits a seemingly senseless murder and faces his own indifference to the world around him. It's a haunting and thought-provoking read with a minimalist approach to storytelling.\n\nI encourage you to browse the library's catalog or ask me for more specific recommendations based on your favorite genres or authors. I can also help you find books by authors from Asian or Pacific Islander backgrounds, if that's of interest to you.\n\n\n\nGood luck finding your next great read!",

The language is concise and impactful.\n* **Tana French:** While her Dublin Murder Squad series might be a bit more character-driven, her standalone novel, \"The Likeness\", fits your description perfectly. It's a dark psychological thriller with a minimalist style.\n* **Paula Hawkins:** \"The Girl on the Train\" is a classic in this genre, featuring unreliable narrators and a gripping mystery. \n\n**Classic Noir:**\n\n* **Raymond Chandler:** If you're open to something a bit older, Chandler's Philip Marlowe novels like \"The Big Sleep\" or \"Farewell, My Lovely\" are iconic examples of hard-boiled noir. They're fast-paced, cynical, and full of atmosphere. \n* **Dashiell Hammett:**  Similar to Chandler, Hammett's \"The Maltese Falcon\" is a classic with a strong sense of place and morally ambiguous characters.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Check out the \"Readers Also Enjoyed\" sections on Goodreads or Amazon for more recommendations based on the titles you like.\n* Browsing our library's shelves in the mystery or thriller sections can also lead to some hidden gems.\n\n\nI'm happy to help you further if you have any specific themes or subgenres in mind.

Build a strong resume and cover letter:**\n\n* **Tailor your resume:** Highlight the skills and experiences most relevant to each job you apply for.\n* **Use keywords:** Look at the job description and incorporate relevant keywords into your resume.\n* **Proofread carefully:**  Typos and grammatical errors can make a bad impression.\n\n**2. Create a professional online presence:**\n\n* **LinkedIn:** Having a LinkedIn profile can greatly boost your job search. Make sure it's up to date and professional. \n* **Other online platforms:** Some industries may benefit from profiles on other platforms, like Github for developers or Behance for designers.\n\n**3. Search for jobs effectively:**\n\n* **Job boards:** Use popular job boards like Indeed, Monster, CareerBuilder, and LinkedIn.\n* **Company websites:** Many companies post open positions directly on their websites.\n* **Networking:** Talk to people in your field and let them know you're looking for work.\n\n**4. Submit a compelling application:**\n\n* **Follow instructions carefully:** Pay attention to the application requirements and deadlines.\n* **Write a personalized cover letter:** Highlight your skills and experiences that make you a good fit for the specific position.\n* **Proofread everything:**  Double-check for any errors before submitting.\n\n**5. Follow up:**\n\n* **Send a thank-you note:** After an interview, send a thank-you note to the interviewer expressing your appreciation for their time.\n* **Check in periodically:** It's okay to follow up with the hiring manager a week or two after applying to inquire about the status of your application.\n\n\nRemember, job hunting takes time and persistence. Don't get discouraged if you don't hear back from every application. Keep refining your resume and cover letter, networking, and applying for jobs that interest you.\n\nI'm here to help you along the way.

The prose is beautiful and evocative, and the characters are complex and flawed.\n* **\"The Little Stranger\" by Sarah Waters:** Set in a crumbling English manor house after World War II, this gothic novel explores themes of class, decay, and the supernatural. The atmosphere is thick with dread, and the characters are haunted by their pasts.\n\n**For a powerful exploration of grief and loss:**\n\n* **\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\" by Jennifer Egan:** This Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is a collection of interconnected stories about music industry figures over several decades. The writing is sharp and witty, but the underlying themes of loss and regret are deeply moving.\n* **\"The Remains of the Day\" by Kazuo Ishiguro:** This Nobel Prize-winning novel follows a butler reflecting on his life spent in service to an English lord. The narrative is restrained and elegant, but the emotional weight of the story is profound.\n\n**For a journey into the human psyche:**\n\n* **\"The Road\" by Cormac McCarthy:** This post-apocalyptic novel tells the story of a father and son struggling to survive in a bleak and desolate world. The prose is spare and poetic, and the story is a stark exploration of human nature.\n* **\"The Stranger\" by Albert Camus:** This existentialist novel follows a man who is indifferent to the world around him, even when he commits a shocking crime. The story is thought-provoking and unsettling, and it raises questions about the meaning of life and death.\n\nI encourage you to browse these titles and see which one captures your interest.

    "response": "Hi Glenn, I understand you're concerned about protecting your privacy online. It's a very important issue, and I'm happy to help you with some steps you can take. \n\nHere's a breakdown of some key areas to focus on:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords & Multi-Factor Authentication:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Use a different, strong password for each online account. A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. \n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate these passwords.\n\n* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, like a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.\n\n**2. Be Careful What You Share:**\n\n* **Think Before You Post:** Be mindful of the information you share on social media. Avoid posting personal details like your full address, phone number, birthdate, or financial information. \n* **Privacy Settings:** Review the privacy settings on your social media accounts and adjust them to limit who can see your posts and information.\n\n**3. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your operating system, apps, and browser up to date. Updates often include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities.\n* **Firewall:** Make sure your computer has a firewall enabled to help block unauthorized access.\n* **Anti-Virus Software:** Use reputable anti-virus software to scan your devices regularly for malware.\n\n**4. Be Aware of Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails:** Be cautious of emails from unknown senders or those asking for personal information. Don't click on links or open attachments unless you are certain they are legitimate.\n* **Verify Websites:** Look for \"https\" in the website address and a padlock icon in the address bar to ensure you are on a secure site before entering sensitive information.\n\n**5. Public Wi-Fi:**\n\n* **Use a VPN:** When using public Wi-Fi, consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic and protect your data.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* **Digital Literacy Workshops:** Check our library's website or events calendar for workshops on online safety and privacy. \n* **Reference Librarians:** Don't hesitate to ask a reference librarian for help with specific privacy concerns or questions. We're here to assist!\n\nRemember, protecting your privacy online is an ongoing process.  By taking these steps and staying informed, you can significantly reduce your risks.\n\n\nIf you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to ask.",

The language is dense and rich, but the story unfolds slowly and immersively.\n* **\"The Sound and the Fury\" by William Faulkner:** This experimental novel explores the decline of a Southern family through the eyes of its four members, each with their own unique voice and perspective. The narrative structure is complex and challenging, but the characters are deeply drawn and the exploration of family, memory, and time is profound.\n* **\"Gravity's Rainbow\" by Thomas Pynchon:** This sprawling, postmodern epic delves into the chaos and absurdity of war, paranoia, and technology. The language can be dense, but the plot is driven by suspense and intrigue, and the philosophical themes are both challenging and rewarding.\n\n**Minimalist Fiction with Action:**\n\n* **\"The Road\" by Cormac McCarthy:** This post-apocalyptic novel tells the story of a father and son journeying across a desolate landscape. The language is sparse but powerful, and the action is stark and relentless. The novel explores themes of survival, hope, and the nature of humanity.\n* **\"The Stranger\" by Albert Camus:** This existentialist novel follows the detached and unfeeling Meursault as he commits a seemingly senseless murder. The plot is tightly paced, and the philosophical questions it raises about morality, meaning, and absurdity are deeply unsettling.\n\n**To help me narrow down the suggestions, could you tell me:**\n\n* **What genres do you typically enjoy?**\n* **Are there any specific themes or topics that particularly interest you?**\n* **Are you open to reading works in translation?**\n\n\nI'm here to help you find the perfect book for your next immersive reading experience!",

I understand you enjoy a slower pace, relatable characters, and a focus on themes and ideas.\n\nGiven your preferences, I have a few suggestions that might be a good fit:\n\n**For a classic exploration of human nature:**\n\n* **\"The Stranger\" by Albert Camus:** This novella is a powerful and thought-provoking look at absurdity and alienation. The protagonist, Meursault, is a man who seems detached from the world around him, leading to a journey that raises questions about morality, justice, and the meaning of life.  The language is direct and sparse, letting the ideas resonate.\n\n**For a journey of self-discovery:**\n\n* **\"The Alchemist\" by Paulo Coelho:** This fable follows a shepherd who travels from his home in Spain to Egypt in search of his \"Personal Legend.\"  It's a beautifully written story about listening to your heart, following your dreams, and the power of belief. \n\n**For a quiet contemplation of life and loss:**\n\n* **\"The Remains of the Day\" by Kazuo Ishiguro:** This novel tells the story of Stevens, a butler who reflects on his life of service and missed opportunities. The prose is elegant and understated, creating a poignant and moving portrait of a man grappling with regret and the passage of time.\n\n**For a modern take on archetypal characters:**\n\n* **\"A Long Petal of the Sea\" by Isabel Allende:** This sweeping historical novel follows a couple fleeing the Spanish Civil War to Chile. While it spans decades and includes many characters, the core story focuses on their resilience, love, and search for belonging. Allende's writing is lyrical and evocative, creating a rich tapestry of human experience.\n\nRemember, these are just a few suggestions, and the best book for you will depend on your individual tastes. \n\nI encourage you to browse our shelves, ask me more questions, or even check out our online catalog for more ideas. I'm always happy to help you find your next great read!",

    "response": "Hello, Terry! I can definitely help you find something gripping. You're looking for a book that's slow-burning, character-driven, with a dark and intense tone, action, and beautiful writing.  \n\nBased on what you're looking for, here are a few suggestions, keeping in mind different authors and styles:\n\n**For a blend of fantasy, mystery, and poetic prose:**\n\n* **The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern:**  This one is magical realism at its finest. Two young magicians are pitted against each other in a mysterious competition within a fantastical circus. The prose is breathtaking, the characters are deeply flawed and complex, and the plot unfolds slowly, building tension and intrigue.\n\n* **Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke:** This is a longer read, but it's worth it! Set in 19th century England, it explores the return of practical magic and the complex relationship between two very different magicians. It's historical fiction with a fantastical twist, full of rich world-building and nuanced characters.\n\n**For a more contemporary, gritty feel:**\n\n* **The Secret History by Donna Tartt:** This is a cult classic known for its dark, atmospheric prose and its exploration of obsession, guilt, and the destructive power of beauty. It follows a group of Classics students at an elite college who become entangled in a dangerous secret.\n* **Gilead by Marilynne Robinson:** This Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is told in the form of a letter from an aging pastor to his young son. It's a meditation on faith, family, and the complexities of human relationships, with beautiful language and a haunting, introspective tone.\n\n**For a blend of action and character development:**\n\n* **The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch:** This is the first in a fantasy heist series with witty dialogue, engaging characters, and plenty of action.  It follows a band of con artists in a fantasy city, and while it's action-packed, it also has a lot of heart and humor.\n\nI encourage you to check out reviews and summaries to see which of these books piques your interest the most.

I understand! \n\nBased on what you're describing, here are a few suggestions that might be a good fit:\n\n* **\"The Road\" by Cormac McCarthy:** This post-apocalyptic novel is known for its bleak, minimalist prose and relentless sense of dread. It follows a father and son as they journey across a desolate landscape, facing danger at every turn. It's action-driven, but the sparse language and stark setting create a truly immersive experience.\n* **\"No Country for Old Men\" by Cormac McCarthy:**  Another McCarthy option, this one is a taut and suspenseful thriller about a hunter who stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong. The story is driven by a relentless, almost supernatural antagonist, and McCarthy's writing style is both poetic and brutal.\n* **\"The Ritual\" by Adam Nevill:** This horror novel centers on a group of friends on a hiking trip in the Swedish wilderness who encounter something ancient and terrifying.  The story builds slowly, with a creeping sense of dread that culminates in a truly horrifying climax.\n\nI encourage you to browse the library's catalogue and see what catches your eye.

Online banking is really convenient, but it's important to keep your information secure. \n\nWhile I can't give specific advice about your bank's website or app, I can share some general tips to help you stay safe:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords are Key:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:** Don't use the same password for your online banking as you do for other accounts.\n* **Length Matters:** Aim for at least 12 characters, mixing uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to store your passwords securely.\n\n**2. Watch Out for Phishing:**\n\n* **Beware of Emails and Texts:**  Never click on links in suspicious emails or texts asking for your banking information.  \n* **Double-Check the Website:** Always type your bank's website address directly into your browser, don't click links from emails. Look for the \"https://\" in the address bar and a padlock icon, which means the site is secure.\n\n**3. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Strong Antivirus:** Keep your computer or mobile device protected with up-to-date antivirus software.\n* **Updates:** Install software updates regularly, as they often include security patches.\n* **Public Wi-Fi Caution:** Be extra cautious when using public Wi-Fi.

It's a powerful and haunting tale about the horrors of slavery, the resilience of the human spirit, and the search for identity. Whitehead's prose is both lyrical and gritty, and the characters are unforgettable.\n* **\"Homegoing\" by Yaa Gyasi:** This epic saga follows the descendants of two half-sisters in Ghana, one sold into slavery in America and the other married to a slave trader. Over generations, the novel explores the impact of slavery and colonialism on families, communities, and nations. Gyasi's writing is beautiful and evocative, and her characters are deeply complex and flawed.\n* **\"Salvage the Bones\" by Jesmyn Ward:** This National Book Award-winning novel tells the story of a poor, Black family in rural Mississippi preparing for Hurricane Katrina. The novel is a raw and unflinching look at poverty, family, and the power of nature. Ward's writing is stark and poetic, and the characters are unforgettable.\n\nThese are just a few suggestions, and there are many other great books out there that might be a good fit for you. \n\nWould you like to tell me a little bit more about your reading preferences?

Let's work together to make your online experience safer. \n\nIt's great that you're taking proactive steps to protect yourself.  I can offer some general tips, but remember, online privacy is a constantly evolving landscape, so staying informed is key.\n\n**Here are some steps you can take to enhance your online privacy:**\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Use a different, strong password for each of your online accounts. \n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate complex passwords.\n\n**2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**\n\n* **Enable 2FA:**  Whenever possible, enable 2FA on your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**3. Be Cautious about What You Share:**\n\n* **Social Media:** Review your privacy settings on social media platforms. Limit the information you share publicly and be mindful of what you post.\n* **Personal Information:** Be cautious about sharing sensitive personal information online, such as your full address, phone number, or financial details, unless you're on a secure website.\n\n**4. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your operating system, apps, and antivirus software up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.\n* **Firewall:** Make sure your computer has a firewall enabled to protect against unauthorized access.\n\n**5. Public Wi-Fi:**\n\n* **VPN:** When using public Wi-Fi, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic.\n\n**6. Phishing Scams:**\n\n* **Be Suspicious:** Be wary of suspicious emails, texts, or calls that ask for personal information. Never click on links or open attachments from unknown senders.\n\n**7. Data Minimization:**\n\n* **Review Permissions:** Regularly review the permissions you've granted to apps on your devices. Only grant access to the information they absolutely need.\n\n**8. Online Tracking:**\n\n* **Privacy Tools:** Explore browser extensions or privacy-focused browsers that can help block tracking cookies and online ads.\n\n**9. Search Engine Privacy:**\n\n* **Privacy Settings:** Adjust your privacy settings in search engines to limit the amount of data they collect about your searches.\n\n**10. Stay Informed:**\n\n* **Online Resources:** Keep yourself updated on online privacy best practices by visiting reputable sources like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) website or the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).\n\n\nI hope these tips are helpful, John. Remember, protecting your privacy is an ongoing process.

It's important to be informed about your rights as a consumer.\n\nHere are some reliable sources you can check out:\n\n**Government Agencies:**\n\n* **Federal Trade Commission (FTC):** The FTC is a great starting point.

You can find them at [https://www.ftc.gov/](https://www.ftc.gov/).\n* **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):** If your query is specifically about financial products and services like loans, credit cards, and mortgages, the CFPB is your go-to resource. They provide clear explanations and tools to help you understand your rights and make informed financial decisions.  Visit them at [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/).\n* **Your State Attorney General's Office:**  Each state has an Attorney General who protects consumers within their state.

They offer unbiased advice and guidance on a range of topics. You can access their website at [https://www.consumerreports.org/](https://www.consumerreports.org/).\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Be wary of websites that promise quick fixes or guaranteed results.**\n* **Look for websites with a .gov or .org domain, as these are typically more reliable than .com sites.**\n* **Check the website's \"About Us\" page to learn more about the organization and its mission.**\n* **Don't hesitate to contact a trusted consumer advocate or attorney if you have specific legal questions or concerns.**\n\nI hope this helps, William.

It follows two magicians in 19th century England as they try to revive English magic. The characters are archetypal yet complex, and the plot unfolds in a fascinatingly unconventional way.\n\n* **The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman:** This shorter novel is a haunting and beautiful tale about childhood, memory, and the power of stories. Gaiman's prose is lyrical and evocative, and the story is both whimsical and unsettling.\n\n**Literary Fiction:**\n\n* **The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern:** This novel has a dreamy, atmospheric quality with a competition between two young magicians playing out in a mysterious, traveling circus. The characters are drawn in broad strokes, but their motivations are complex and intriguing.\n\n* **Life After Life by Kate Atkinson:** This novel explores the concept of reincarnation through the life of Ursula Todd, who dies repeatedly, each time living a slightly different version of her life. The prose is sharp and witty, and the story is both thought-provoking and deeply moving.\n\n**Something a Little Different:**\n\n* **The House in the Cerulean Sea by T.J. Klune:** This heartwarming fantasy novel features a social worker investigating a home for magical children. It's charming, funny, and full of heart, with a touch of whimsy.\n\n**To help me narrow down the suggestions, could you tell me:**\n\n* **Are there any specific themes or genres you're particularly interested in?** (e.g., coming-of-age, mystery, romance)\n* **Are there any authors you particularly enjoy?**\n* **What do you mean by \"action-driven plot\"?** (e.g., fast-paced adventure, internal conflict, political intrigue)\n\n\n\nI'm here to help you find the perfect book for your next immersive reading experience!",

It's great that you're taking steps to protect yourself! \n\nI can't give specific advice about your bank's website or app since I don't have access to that information. However, I can share some general tips for safe online banking that apply to most institutions:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique and Complex:** Use a different, strong password for each online account, including your bank. A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to help you create and store strong, unique passwords.\n\n**2. Secure Connections:**\n\n* **https:** Always make sure you're on a secure website before entering any personal information. Look for \"https://\" in the address bar and a padlock symbol.\n* **Public Wi-Fi:** Avoid using public Wi-Fi for online banking. These networks are often unsecured and could be monitored by someone trying to steal your information.\n\n**3. Beware of Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails and Texts:** Be wary of emails or texts asking for your login information or account details. Legitimate banks will never ask for this information via email or text.\n* **Hover Over Links:** Before clicking on links in emails or texts, hover your mouse over them to see the actual URL. If it looks suspicious, don't click it.\n\n**4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**\n\n* **Enable MFA:** Most banks now offer MFA, which adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to enter a code from your phone or email in addition to your password. Enable this feature if it's available.\n\n**5. Monitor Your Accounts:**\n\n* **Regularly Check:** Check your bank statements and account balances regularly for any unauthorized transactions.\n* **Report Suspicious Activity:** If you see anything suspicious, contact your bank immediately.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* **Computer Access:** Our library offers free computer access and internet service. You can use our computers to do your online banking in a safe and secure environment.\n* **Digital Literacy Classes:** We also offer classes on digital literacy, including online safety and security. These classes can teach you more about how to protect yourself online.\n\n\nRemember, if you have any specific concerns or questions about your bank's online platform, it's always best to contact them directly for personalized assistance.",

    "response": "Hi Roscoe, thanks for coming to the library! I understand you're concerned about protecting your privacy online, and that's a very important issue. \n\nThere are lots of things you can do to stay safer online.  Let's break it down step by step:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Use a different, strong password for every online account. A strong password has at least 12 characters and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to help you create and store strong, unique passwords. There are free and paid options available.\n\n**2. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your operating system, browser, and apps updated. These updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities.\n* **Firewall:** Make sure your computer or mobile device has a firewall enabled. This helps block unauthorized access to your device.\n* **Antivirus Software:** Install and regularly update antivirus software to protect against malware and viruses.\n\n**3. Be Careful What You Share:**\n\n* **Think Before You Post:** Before sharing anything online, ask yourself: \"Do I really need to share this?\" and \"Who might see this?\"\n* **Limit Personal Information:** Be cautious about sharing personal information like your address, phone number, or birthdate on social media or public websites.\n\n**4. Protect Your Social Media:**\n\n* **Privacy Settings:** Review your privacy settings on social media platforms and adjust them to limit who can see your posts and information.\n* **Be Wary of Links:** Don't click on links from unknown sources. They could lead to phishing websites designed to steal your information.\n\n**5. Secure Your Wi-Fi:**\n\n* **Strong Wi-Fi Password:** Use a strong password for your home Wi-Fi network.\n* **Public Wi-Fi Caution:** Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities like online banking or shopping. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a virtual private network (VPN).\n\n**6. Two-Factor Authentication:**\n\n* **Enable 2FA:** Whenever possible, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**7. Be Aware of Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails:** Be wary of suspicious emails or messages that ask for personal information.\n* **Hover Over Links:** Before clicking on any links in emails, hover your mouse over them to see the actual URL. If it looks suspicious, don't click.\n\n**8. Regular Backups:**\n\n* **Back Up Data:** Regularly back up your important data to an external hard drive or cloud storage service. This will help protect you in case of data loss due to a cyberattack.\n\n **Resources:**\n\n* **Privacy Rights Clearinghouse:** https://privacyrights.org/\n* **Federal Trade Commission (FTC):** https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/online-privacy\n* **National Cyber Security Alliance:** https://staysafeonline.org/\n\nRemember, protecting your privacy online is an ongoing process. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you have any questions.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with today, Roscoe?",

You're looking for a book that's a real head-scratcher, full of heart, and beautifully written. \n\nLet me see...  \n\nSince you enjoy a fast pace and archetypal characters, but also crave complexity and depth, I wonder if you'd be interested in something like **\"Circe\" by Madeline Miller**. It's a retelling of the Greek myth of Circe, the sorceress, and while it has a classic hero's journey structure, Miller delves deeply into Circe's inner world, her complex relationships, and the struggles of female power. It's a captivating read with lyrical prose and a surprisingly heartwarming message about self-acceptance.\n\nAnother option might be **\"The House in the Cerulean Sea\" by T.J. Klune**. This book has a whimsical, magical realism tone with heartwarming characters and a feel-good plot.  While the characters are archetypal in some ways (the grumpy caretaker, the magical children), Klune explores themes of found family, acceptance, and challenging societal norms with a lot of heart. \n\nCould either of these sound appealing? I'm happy to offer more suggestions if you'd like to tell me a little more about what kind of story elements you particularly enjoy. For example, are you looking for fantasy, contemporary, historical fiction, or something else entirely?",

Gather Your Information:**\n\n* **Personal Information:**  You'll need your Social Security number (or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number if applicable), birth date, address, and filing status (single, married filing jointly, etc.).\n* **Income Documents:** Collect W-2s from your employers, 1099s for any freelance or contract work, interest and dividend statements (1099-INT and 1099-DIV), and any other relevant income documents.\n* **Deduction and Credit Information:** Gather documents related to potential deductions and credits, such as mortgage interest statements (1098), student loan interest statements (1098-E), childcare expenses, charitable donations, and medical expenses.\n\n**2.

It's brutally honest, darkly satirical, and definitely not for the faint of heart. The characters are archetypal representations of wealth, consumerism, and violence.\n\n* **\"The Girl on the Train\" by Paula Hawkins:** This thriller features unreliable narrators, suspenseful twists, and a gripping mystery. The characters are complex and flawed, caught in a web of secrets and lies. The dark and intense tone will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\n**Character-Driven and Literary:**\n\n* **\"The Road\" by Cormac McCarthy:** This post-apocalyptic novel tells the story of a father and son struggling to survive in a desolate world. McCarthy's sparse, poetic prose creates a powerful and haunting atmosphere. The characters are deeply human, grappling with loss, hope, and the nature of good and evil.\n\n* **\"A Clockwork Orange\" by Anthony Burgess:** This dystopian novel explores themes of violence, free will, and societal control.  The protagonist, Alex, is a charismatic but terrifyingly violent young man who undergoes experimental therapy to \"cure\" his criminal tendencies. The novel's unique language and style make it a challenging but rewarding read.\n\n**Important Note:** Remember that taste in books is subjective. \n\nThese are just a few suggestions based on your preferences.

Let's explore some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:** Use a different, strong password for each online account. A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to securely store all your passwords. These tools generate strong passwords and automatically fill them in for you. \n\n**2. Be Careful What You Share:**\n\n* **Social Media:** Review your privacy settings on social media platforms. Limit the amount of personal information you share publicly. Be mindful of what photos and posts you make, as they can be seen by a wider audience than you might expect.\n* **Online Forms:** Be cautious about providing personal information on websites, especially if you're not familiar with them. Look for \"https\" in the URL and a padlock icon to ensure a secure connection.\n\n**3. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your operating system, browser, and apps updated. Updates often include security patches that protect against known vulnerabilities.\n* **Firewall:** Make sure your computer has a firewall enabled to block unauthorized access.\n* **Antivirus Software:** Install reputable antivirus software and keep it updated to protect against malware and viruses.\n\n**4. Public Wi-Fi Caution:**\n\n* **Avoid Sensitive Transactions:** Avoid accessing bank accounts or making online purchases on public Wi-Fi networks. These networks are often unsecured.\n* **VPN:** Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) when using public Wi-Fi to encrypt your internet traffic.\n\n**5. Be Aware of Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails:** Be wary of emails from unknown senders or those asking for personal information. Don't click on links or download attachments from suspicious emails.\n* **Fake Websites:** Be careful of websites that look official but might be fake. Check the URL carefully and look for signs of a secure connection (https).\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\nThe library has many resources to help you learn more about online privacy. We offer:\n\n* **Books and ebooks:** We have a selection of books on cybersecurity and online safety.\n* **Online Databases:** Access to reputable websites and articles on privacy topics.\n* **Computer Classes:** We offer classes on digital literacy and online safety.\n\n**Remember:** Protecting your privacy is an ongoing process.

It's action-packed and thought-provoking, exploring themes of human resilience and the power of technology.\n* **\"The Handmaid's Tale\" by Margaret Atwood:** This dystopian novel examines themes of gender, power, and control in a chillingly realistic way.

That's a common concern, and it's great that you're being cautious! \n\nI can't give you specific advice on your individual bank's system, as each one is different. However, I can give you some general tips on how to keep your online banking safe:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:** Use a different, strong password for each of your online accounts, especially your bank. \n* **Password Strength:** Make sure your passwords are long (at least 12 characters), include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n\n **2. Secure Connections:**\n\n* **Look for \"HTTPS\":**  Before entering any personal information, check the website address. It should start with \"https://\" and have a padlock icon in the address bar. This means the connection is encrypted and secure.\n* **Public Wi-Fi Caution:** Be extra careful when using public Wi-Fi. Hackers can sometimes intercept information sent over unsecured networks. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for added security.\n\n**3. Device Security:**\n\n* **Keep Software Updated:** Regularly update your operating system, browser, and security software to patch any vulnerabilities.\n* **Beware of Phishing:** Be wary of suspicious emails or messages asking for your personal information. Banks will never ask for your password or account number via email or text.\n* **Antivirus Protection:** Install and keep up-to-date antivirus software on your computer and mobile devices.\n\n**4. Account Monitoring:**\n\n* **Regularly Review Statements:** Check your bank statements regularly for any unauthorized transactions. Report any suspicious activity immediately to your bank.\n* **Transaction Alerts:**  Many banks offer transaction alerts that notify you of any activity on your account. Set up these alerts to stay informed.\n\n**5. Bank's Security Features:**\n\n* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Enable 2FA whenever possible.

McCarthy's language is stark and unforgiving, reflecting the harshness of their environment.\n\n* **\"The Handmaid's Tale\" by Margaret Atwood:**  This dystopian classic explores themes of gender, power, and control through the eyes of Offred, a woman forced into sexual servitude in a totalitarian society. Atwood's writing is sharp and precise, creating a chillingly realistic vision of the future.\n\n* **\"No Country for Old Men\" by Cormac McCarthy:**  A suspenseful thriller set in the American Southwest, this novel follows a hunter who stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong. McCarthy's spare prose and morally ambiguous characters make for a gripping and unsettling read.\n\n* **\"The Martian\" by Andy Weir:** While technically science fiction, this novel tackles themes of survival, resilience, and the human spirit with a surprisingly philosophical edge. Weir's writing is clear, concise, and engaging, making the technical details of space travel accessible and exciting.\n\n* **\"Gone Girl\" by Gillian Flynn:** This twisty thriller explores the dark side of marriage and the complexities of identity. Flynn's writing is sharp and witty, keeping you guessing until the very end.\n\n\nI encourage you to browse these titles and see which one piques your interest.

    "response": "Hi Pamela,\n\nI understand your concern about online privacy. It's important to protect yourself in this digital age.  \n\nThere are many things you can do to enhance your online privacy. Let's break it down into manageable steps:\n\n**1.  Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Use a different, strong password for each of your online accounts.  A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate these complex passwords.  \n\n**2.  Be Careful What You Share:**\n\n* **Think Before You Post:**  Be mindful of personal information you share on social media. Avoid posting your full address, phone number, or birthdate publicly.\n* **Privacy Settings:** Review the privacy settings on your social media accounts and limit who can see your posts, photos, and other information.\n\n**3.  Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your operating system, apps, and browser up to date. Updates often include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities.\n* **Antivirus/Anti-Malware:** Install reliable antivirus and anti-malware software on your computer and mobile devices.\n\n**4.  Public Wi-Fi Caution:**\n\n* **Avoid Sensitive Activities:**  Don't access sensitive information like bank accounts or online shopping while connected to public Wi-Fi networks.\n* **VPN:**  Consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) when using public Wi-Fi to encrypt your internet traffic.\n\n**5.  Email Security:**\n\n* **Phishing Scams:** Be wary of suspicious emails, especially those asking for personal information. Don't click on links or open attachments from unknown senders.\n* **Two-Factor Authentication:** Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your email account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or another device in addition to your password.\n\n**6.  Data Management:**\n\n* **Review App Permissions:** Pay attention to the permissions you grant to apps when you install them. Only allow access to the information they truly need.\n* **Clear Browsing Data:** Regularly clear your browser's cache, cookies, and browsing history to reduce the amount of data stored on your device.\n\n**7.  Online Privacy Tools:**\n\n* **Privacy-Focused Browser:** Consider using a privacy-focused web browser like Brave or Firefox, which have built-in features to block trackers and protect your privacy.\n* **Ad Blockers:** Install an ad blocker to prevent advertisers from tracking your online activity.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\nThe library can be a great resource for learning more about online privacy.

However, I can certainly guide you to some excellent resources that can help!\n\n**Here are some steps you can take:**\n\n1. **Determine if you qualify for free tax preparation assistance:**\n\n* **IRS Free File:** The IRS partners with free tax software providers to offer free filing for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes (AGIs) below certain thresholds. You can find more information and see if you qualify on the IRS website at [https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free).\n* **Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA):** VITA offers free tax help to people who generally make $58,000 or less, persons with disabilities, and limited English-speaking taxpayers. Find a VITA site near you: [https://www.irs.gov/individuals/free-tax-return-preparation-for-qualifying-taxpayers](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/free-tax-return-preparation-for-qualifying-taxpayers).\n* **Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE):** TCE offers free tax help for all taxpayers, particularly those who are 60 years of age and older, specializing in questions about pensions and retirement-related issues. Find a TCE site near you: [https://www.irs.gov/individuals/free-tax-return-preparation-for-qualifying-taxpayers](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/free-tax-return-preparation-for-qualifying-taxpayers).\n\n2. **Choose a tax preparation software:** If you prefer to file yourself, there are many reputable tax software options available, both free and paid. Some popular choices include TurboTax, H&R Block, and TaxAct.\n\n3. **Gather your tax documents:** You'll need to collect all of your necessary tax documents, such as W-2s, 1099s, and other income and expense records.\n\n4. **Follow the software instructions:** Each tax software program has its own set of instructions, but generally, you'll need to enter your personal information, income, deductions, and credits.\n\n5. **Review and file your return:** Carefully review your completed tax return before filing it electronically.\n\n\nRemember, if you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to the IRS directly or consult with a qualified tax professional. \n\nI hope this helps, Erin!

The prose is spare and poetic, the plot is relentlessly paced, and the characters, though archetypal, are deeply affecting.\n\n**2. *Child of God* by Cormac McCarthy:** This intense and disturbing novel explores the dark underbelly of human nature through the story of a deeply troubled hermit. McCarthy's prose is stark and poetic, and the story is both unsettling and unforgettable.\n\n**3. *The Lord of the Rings* by J.R.R. Tolkien:** While this epic fantasy series might seem like an unconventional choice, it fits your criteria in many ways. It features archetypal characters, a sweeping plot driven by action and adventure, and Tolkien's prose is undeniably beautiful and immersive.\n\n**4. *Blood Meridian* by Cormac McCarthy:**  This is another brutal and unflinching novel from McCarthy that delves into the darkest recesses of the American West. The prose is stunningly poetic, the plot is driven by violence and survival, and the characters are complex and unforgettable. \n\n**5. *The Name of the Wind* by Patrick Rothfuss:** This fantasy novel features a compelling protagonist who recounts his own story, filled with magic, adventure, and a dark, brooding tone. The prose is lyrical and immersive, and the plot is both intricate and engaging.\n\nThese are just a few suggestions to get you started.

That's a very important concern.\n\nWhile I can't give specific financial advice, I can definitely share some general tips for staying safe while banking online:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Use a different, strong password for each of your online accounts.  \n\n* **Password Length:** Aim for at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate unique passwords for you.\n\n**2. Secure Connection:**\n\n* **https:** Always make sure the website address starts with \"https://\" and has a padlock icon in the address bar. This indicates a secure connection.\n\n* **Public Wi-Fi:** Avoid online banking on public Wi-Fi networks whenever possible. These networks are often unsecured.\n\n**3. Phishing Awareness:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails/Texts:** Be cautious of emails or texts asking for personal information. Never click on links or attachments from unknown senders.\n\n* **Official Contact:** Always contact your bank directly through their official website or phone number if you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a communication.\n\n**4. Two-Factor Authentication:**\n\n* **Extra Security:** Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**5. Device Security:**\n\n* **Updates:** Keep your computer and mobile devices updated with the latest security patches.\n\n* **Antivirus Software:** Use reputable antivirus software to protect your devices from malware.\n\n**6. Review Statements Regularly:**\n\n* **Monitor Activity:** Check your online banking statements regularly for any unauthorized transactions.\n\n**7. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Lock Screen:** Use a strong password or biometric lock on your devices.\n\n* **Lost Devices:** If you lose your device, contact your bank immediately to report it lost or stolen.\n\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* **Computer Access:** We offer free computer access and Wi-Fi for all library patrons.\n\n* **Digital Literacy Programs:** We offer workshops and classes on various digital literacy topics, including online safety and security.\n\n* **Consumer Protection Resources:** We have resources from organizations like the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) that provide information on online security and fraud prevention.\n\n\nI hope these tips are helpful, Lisa. Remember, if you ever have any doubts or concerns about online banking, don't hesitate to contact your bank directly.\n\nIs there anything else I can assist you with today?\n\n\nRemember, I'm here to help you navigate the information world safely and confidently.",

While I can't give specific legal or technical advice, I can offer some general tips to help you get started:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords & Multi-Factor Authentication:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Use strong, unique passwords for every online account.  A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.  \n\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to help you create and store strong, unique passwords. \n\n* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Whenever possible, enable MFA on your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**2. Be Careful What You Share:**\n\n* **Think Before You Post:**  Be mindful of what personal information you share on social media and other online platforms. Avoid sharing sensitive details like your full address, phone number, birthdate, or financial information publicly.\n\n* **Review Privacy Settings:** Regularly review the privacy settings on your social media accounts and other online services.  Adjust them to limit who can see your information.\n\n**3. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your operating system, apps, and browser up to date. Updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities. \n\n* **Antivirus & Firewall:** Use reliable antivirus software and a firewall to protect your devices from malware and other threats.\n\n* **Public Wi-Fi Caution:** Be cautious about using public Wi-Fi networks. Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic when connecting to public Wi-Fi.\n\n**4. Be Wary of Phishing Scams:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails & Links:**  Be wary of suspicious emails or links, especially those that ask for personal information or urge you to click on something quickly. \n\n* **Verify Requests:** If you receive a request for personal information, verify its legitimacy by contacting the organization directly through a known, trusted channel.\n\n**5. Learn More:**\n\n* **Online Privacy Resources:**  The library has many resources on online privacy, including books, articles, and websites. \n\n* **Online Safety Organizations:**  Organizations like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) offer valuable information and tips on protecting your privacy online.\n\n\nPlease remember, protecting your privacy online is an ongoing process. Stay informed about new threats and best practices. \n\nIs there anything specific you'd like to discuss further, Ronald?

However, I can offer general tips that apply to most online banking platforms:\n\n**1. Secure your device:**\n\n* **Strong passwords:**  Use a unique, strong password for your online banking that combines uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or pet names.\n* **Multi-factor authentication (MFA):**  Enable MFA whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n* **Keep software updated:** Make sure your operating system, web browser, and antivirus software are always up to date. Updates often include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities.\n\n**2. Protect your information:**\n\n* **Be wary of phishing:**  Never click on links in emails or text messages that ask for your login information or other personal details.  Always go directly to your bank's website by typing the address in your browser.\n* **Public Wi-Fi:** Avoid accessing your online banking on public Wi-Fi networks unless you're using a Virtual Private Network (VPN).  \n\n**3. Monitor your accounts:**\n\n* **Regularly check your statements:** Look for any unauthorized transactions and report them to your bank immediately.\n* **Set up alerts:** Many banks offer email or text alerts for account activity. This can help you catch suspicious activity quickly.\n\n**4. Secure your physical devices:**\n\n* **Lock your computer:** Always lock your computer when you're away from it, even for a short time.\n* **Use a secure browser:** Consider using a browser with built-in security features, like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* **Free online courses:** We offer free online courses on digital literacy and cybersecurity. These courses can provide more in-depth information on online safety and best practices.\n* **Computer workstations:** You can use our public computers to access your online banking in a secure environment.\n* **Staff assistance:** Our staff can assist you with basic computer skills and online banking questions.\n\nRemember, your online security is important.
