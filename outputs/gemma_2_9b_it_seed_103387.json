That's a very important concern, and I'm happy to help guide you through some best practices.\n\nWhile I can't give specific advice about your bank's particular system, I can offer general tips to keep your online banking secure:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:** Use a different, strong password for each online account, including your bank.\n* **Password Strength:** Aim for a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Make it at least 12 characters long and something you won't easily forget.\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate strong passwords.\n\n**2. Secure Connection:**\n\n* **HTTPS:** Always ensure you're on a secure website before entering any banking information. Look for \"https://\" in the web address and a padlock icon in the address bar. This indicates an encrypted connection.\n* **Public Wi-Fi:** Avoid accessing your bank account on public Wi-Fi networks unless you're using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Public Wi-Fi can be vulnerable to security risks.\n\n**3. Be wary of Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails/Text Messages:** Don't click on links or open attachments in emails or text messages from unknown senders, even if they appear to be from your bank. Banks will never ask for your password or account details via email or text.\n* **Official Website:** Always access your bank account through the official website or mobile app, not by clicking on links in emails or messages.\n\n**4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**\n\n* **Enable MFA:** Most banks now offer MFA, which adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password. Enable this feature if available.\n\n**5. Monitor Your Accounts:**\n\n* **Regularly Review Statements:** Check your bank statements regularly for any unauthorized transactions.\n* **Set Up Alerts:** Many banks offer transaction alerts that notify you of any activity on your account.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* **Computer Classes:** We offer free computer classes, including ones on online safety and digital literacy. \n* **Internet Access:** You can access the internet safely at the library.\n* **Staff Assistance:** Our librarians are here to help answer your questions and provide guidance on using online banking safely.\n\n\nRemember, your financial security is important. If you have any specific concerns or questions about your bank's online system, it's always best to contact them directly.  Don't hesitate to ask me if you have any other questions.",

While I can't provide specific tax advice as I'm not a financial professional, I can definitely guide you through the general steps and point you to some helpful resources. \n\nFirst, let's figure out what you need:\n\n1. **Gather your documents:** You'll need things like your Social Security number, W-2s from your employer(s), 1099s for any freelance or contract work, and information about any deductions or credits you may be eligible for.\n\n2. **Choose your filing method:**\n    * **Tax preparation software:** This is a popular option, as it guides you through the process step-by-step and often catches errors.

You can find more information and see if you qualify on the IRS website: [https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free)\n    * **Tax preparation services:** You can also hire a professional to prepare your taxes for you. \n\n3. **Create an account:** Most filing methods require you to create an online account.\n\n4. **Input your information:** Carefully enter all the required information from your documents. Double-check everything for accuracy!\n\n5. **Review and submit:** Before submitting, review your return carefully to make sure everything is correct. Once you're satisfied, submit your return electronically.\n\nRemember, it's important to file your taxes on time. The tax deadline is typically April 15th each year.\n\nI hope this helps, Mary!

It's important for everyone, and it can feel overwhelming to know where to start.  \n\nHere are some steps you can take to improve your online privacy:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords & Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Create strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts. A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. \n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to help you create and store strong, unique passwords securely. \n\n* **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Enable MFA whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring you to provide a second form of identification, like a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.\n\n**2. Be Careful What You Share:**\n\n* **Think Before You Post:** Ask yourself if you really need to share personal information online. Avoid posting your full name, address, phone number, or other sensitive details publicly.\n* **Review Privacy Settings:** Regularly review the privacy settings on your social media accounts and other online platforms.  Adjust them to control who can see your posts and information.\n\n**3. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your operating system, browser, and apps up to date. Updates often include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities.\n* **Firewall:** Make sure your computer has a firewall enabled to help block unauthorized access.\n* **Antivirus Software:** Use reliable antivirus software to protect your devices from malware.\n\n**4. Be Aware of Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails & Links:** Be cautious of emails or links from unknown senders. Don't click on links or open attachments from sources you don't trust.\n* **Verify Requests:** If you receive a request for personal information, verify its legitimacy by contacting the organization directly through a known channel.\n\n**5. Secure Your Wi-Fi:**\n\n* **Strong Passwords:** Use a strong password for your home Wi-Fi network and change it regularly.\n* **Encryption:** Enable Wi-Fi encryption (WPA2 or WPA3) to protect your data when connecting to public Wi-Fi.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* **Free Online Safety Workshops:** The library often hosts workshops on online safety and digital literacy. Check our website or calendar for upcoming events.\n* **Privacy Guides & Tutorials:** We have books, articles, and online resources that provide more in-depth information about online privacy.\n\nRemember, protecting your privacy is an ongoing process. Stay informed about online threats and best practices, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you have any questions.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or would like to explore any of these topics further.  I'm here to help!",

    "response": "Hello Rafael, I understand you're having trouble with online banking safely. That's a common concern, and I'm happy to help walk you through some basic safety tips.  \n\nRemember, I can't give specific advice about your bank's website or app, as I don't have access to that information. But, I can share some general guidelines to keep your banking secure:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique and Complex:** Use a different, strong password for each of your online accounts, including your bank. A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.  \n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to help you create and store strong, unique passwords. These tools encrypt your passwords, so they're safe even if someone gains access to your device.\n\n**2. Secure Connections:**\n\n* **Look for \"https\":** Always make sure the website address starts with \"https://\" and has a padlock icon in the address bar. This indicates a secure connection.\n* **Public Wi-Fi Caution:** Avoid logging into your banking account on public Wi-Fi networks whenever possible. These networks are often unsecured, making it easier for hackers to intercept your information. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your connection.\n\n**3. Be Wary of Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails and Texts:**  Be cautious of emails or texts asking for your banking information. Legitimate banks will never ask for your password or account number via email or text.\n* **Hover Over Links:** Before clicking on any links in emails or texts, hover your mouse over them to see the actual URL. If it looks suspicious, don't click it.\n* **Contact Your Bank Directly:** If you're ever unsure about the legitimacy of a communication, contact your bank directly using a known phone number or website to verify.\n\n**4. Two-Factor Authentication:**\n\n* **Enable it if Available:** Many banks offer two-factor authentication (2FA), which adds an extra layer of security. This usually involves entering a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**5. Monitor Your Accounts:**\n\n* **Regularly Review Statements:** Check your bank statements regularly for any unauthorized transactions. Report any suspicious activity to your bank immediately.\n* **Set Up Alerts:** Many banks offer alerts for transactions above a certain amount or for unusual activity.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\nWhile I can't give specific banking advice, the library may have resources that can help you learn more about online safety and digital literacy. We often have:\n\n* **Computer classes:** Check our schedule for classes on online security and banking.\n* **Printed materials:** We may have brochures or guides on online safety and financial literacy.\n* **Trusted websites:** Our librarians can point you to reputable websites with information on online banking and security.\n\n\nI hope these tips are helpful, Rafael. Remember, if you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to contact your bank directly.",

Woolf's prose is lyrical and hypnotic, making for a truly immersive experience.\n\n**Contemporary:**\n\n* **\"The Secret History\" by Donna Tartt:** This dark and atmospheric novel follows a group of Classics students who become entangled in a murder plot. Tartt's writing is gorgeous and unsettling, and the characters are deeply flawed and fascinating.\n* **\"A Little Life\" by Hanya Yanagihara:** This is a long and emotionally demanding read, but it's also incredibly powerful. It explores themes of trauma, love, and friendship with unflinching honesty.\n\n**Other Genres:**\n\n* **\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\" by Neil Gaiman:** This blend of fantasy and realism tells the story of a man who returns to his childhood home and confronts a dark secret from his past. Gaiman's writing is both beautiful and unsettling, and the story will stay with you long after you finish reading.\n\nBefore you choose, I encourage you to read a few reviews or excerpts to see which book speaks to you the most. \n\nDo any of these titles sound particularly intriguing?

It's great you're looking for something immersive and atmospheric. \n\nGiven your preferences, I think you might enjoy some of these authors and titles:\n\n**Literary Fiction with a Dark Edge:**\n\n* **Cormac McCarthy:** His writing is sparse and poetic, with a focus on survival and the human condition.  \n\n    * Start with *The Road*. It's a bleak but beautiful post-apocalyptic story told in a straightforward, almost conversational style.  The characters are archetypal - a father and son struggling to survive - which makes their journey all the more powerful.\n\n* **Stephen King:** Though known for horror, King often writes with a deep sense of empathy for his characters, even the flawed ones. He also excels at building suspense and atmosphere.\n\n    * Try *The Green Mile*. It's about a prison guard who encounters a death row inmate with supernatural abilities. While it deals with heavy themes, the story is told in a simple and engaging way.\n\n* **Haruki Murakami:** His novels often blend realism with the surreal, creating a dreamlike and unsettling atmosphere.\n\n    * *Kafka on the Shore* is a good entry point. It follows two unconnected characters - a teenager who runs away from home and an old man who can talk to cats - whose lives unexpectedly intertwine.\n\n**Remember:** \n\n*  You can always ask me for more recommendations based on these authors or specific themes you're interested in. \n*  I can also help you find audiobooks or ebooks if you prefer to listen rather than read.\n\n\nHappy reading!",

Let's see what we can find. \n\nSince you like complex characters and a straightforward plot, I'm thinking we might want to steer clear of something overly convoluted or experimental. \n\nHere are a few ideas based on your request:\n\n* **\"Checkout 19\" by Claire-Louise Bennett:** This novel follows a nameless woman who works at a library and finds herself drawn into the lives of the people she encounters. It's minimalist in its language and has a very quirky, observational tone. The story is driven by the woman's internal thoughts and feelings, which are complex and well-developed.\n* **\"Good Omens\" by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman:** This humorous blend of fantasy and apocalypse features a demon and an angel teaming up to prevent the coming of the Antichrist. While the story is fantastical, the language is witty and accessible, and the characters, despite being supernatural, are deeply relatable.\n* **\"A Confederacy of Dunces\" by John Kennedy Toole:** This classic novel features the unforgettable Ignatius J. Reilly, a brilliant but lazy and eccentric protagonist. The story is fast-paced and humorous, with Ignatius's misadventures driving the plot forward.  The writing is sharp and satirical, but the underlying themes of loneliness and alienation are surprisingly poignant.\n\nI can also recommend some more contemporary authors who might fit your tastes:\n\n* **Jenny Offill:** Her novels, like \"Dept. of Speculation,\" are known for their sparse, fragmented style and exploration of complex female characters.\n* **George Saunders:** His short stories are often darkly humorous and surreal, with a focus on social commentary and the human condition.\n\nTo help me narrow down the perfect book for you, could you tell me more about:\n\n* **What genres do you usually enjoy?** (e.g., sci-fi, fantasy, mystery, romance)\n* **Are there any authors you particularly like?**\n* **What kind of tone are you looking for?** (e.g., humorous, thought-provoking, suspenseful)\n\n\nLet's find that perfect book together!",

The writing is clear and evocative, and the characters are relatable and endearing.\n\n**Nonfiction:**\n\n* **\"The Sun and Her Flowers\" by Rupi Kaur:** This collection of poetry explores themes of love, loss, healing, and growth. Kaur's words are simple yet profound, and her illustrations add a beautiful visual element. It's a perfect choice for a quiet evening of reflection and self-discovery.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* Check out our **book clubs:** We have several groups that focus on different genres, including heartwarming fiction.

    "response": "Hello Eamonn,\n\nIt sounds like you're facing some challenges with online job applications. I'm happy to help guide you through the process.  \n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n**1. Identifying Your Skills and Interests:**\n\n* What kind of work are you interested in? What are you good at? \n* Think about your past experiences, even if they're not directly related to the job you're seeking.  Every job requires certain skills, like communication, teamwork, or problem-solving.\n\n**2. Finding Job Listings:**\n\n* **Online Job Boards:**  Websites like Indeed, Monster, CareerBuilder, and LinkedIn are great places to start. You can search by job title, location, and keywords related to your skills.\n* **Company Websites:** Many companies post job openings directly on their websites. Look for a \"Careers\" or \"Jobs\" section.\n* **Local Resources:** \n    * Your local newspaper might have a classifieds section with job listings.\n    *  Check with your local workforce development center or unemployment office. They often have job boards and resources specific to your area.\n\n**3. Creating a Resume:**\n\n* **Format:**  There are many resume templates available online. Choose one that's easy to read and highlights your skills and experience. \n* **Content:**  \n    * **Contact Information:** Your name, phone number, email address, and optionally, your LinkedIn profile (if you have one).\n    * **Summary:** A brief overview of your skills and experience.\n    * **Work Experience:** List your previous jobs in reverse chronological order (most recent first). Include your job title, company name, dates of employment, and a description of your responsibilities and achievements.\n    * **Education:**  List your education history, including degrees earned and institutions attended.\n    * **Skills:** List your relevant skills, both hard skills (technical abilities) and soft skills (communication, teamwork, etc.).\n\n**4. Writing a Cover Letter:**\n\n* **Purpose:** A cover letter is a personalized introduction to your resume. It explains why you're interested in the specific job and how your skills and experience match the requirements. \n* **Structure:** \n    * **Introduction:** State your interest in the position and where you saw the job posting.\n    * **Middle Paragraphs:** Highlight your relevant skills and experience and explain how they align with the job requirements. Provide specific examples.\n    * **Conclusion:** Reiterate your interest and thank the employer for their time and consideration.\n\n**5. Applying Online:**\n\n* **Read the Instructions Carefully:** Each application may have specific instructions. Pay attention to the required documents (resume, cover letter, etc.) and formatting guidelines.\n* **Proofread Carefully:**  Double-check your application for any errors in grammar, spelling, or punctuation. \n* **Save a Copy:**  Keep a copy of your application for your records.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Network:** Talk to people you know about job openings. \n* **Practice Interviewing:** Prepare for potential interview questions and practice your answers out loud. The library has resources like practice interview guides and online mock interviews.\n* **Don't Give Up:** The job search can be challenging, but persistence is key.\n\nRemember, I'm here to help! If you have any questions about specific websites, need help formatting your resume, or want to practice interview questions, please don't hesitate to ask.",

I can definitely give you some tips to help you protect yourself.  \n\nLet's break it down into manageable steps:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Use a different, strong password for each of your online accounts. This way, if one account is compromised, the others are safer.\n* **Password Strength:**  Make your passwords at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. \n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to help you create and store strong, unique passwords. There are free and paid options available.\n\n**2. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Software Updates:**  Keep your operating system, browser, and apps updated. Updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities.\n* **Device Passcodes:**  Use a passcode, PIN, or biometric lock (fingerprint or face ID) to protect your devices from unauthorized access.\n\n**3. Be Careful What You Share:**\n\n* **Social Media:**  Think before you post! Be mindful of the information you share publicly on social media. Avoid posting personal details like your address, phone number, or birthdate.\n* **Online Forms:**  Be cautious about filling out online forms. Only provide the information that is absolutely necessary.\n\n**4. Secure Wi-Fi:**\n\n* **Public Wi-Fi:** Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for sensitive activities like online banking or shopping. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a virtual private network (VPN).\n* **Home Network:**  Use a strong password for your home Wi-Fi network.\n\n**5. Review Privacy Settings:**\n\n* **Apps and Websites:**  Regularly review the privacy settings for your apps and websites. See what information they collect and how they use it.\n* **Account Settings:**  Check your account settings to see what permissions you've granted to different apps and services.\n\n**6. Be Aware of Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails:**  Be wary of emails from unknown senders or that ask for personal information. Don't click on links or open attachments from suspicious emails.\n* **Phishing Scams:**  Be aware of phishing scams, which try to trick you into giving away your personal information.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* **Online Privacy Guides:** The library likely has online guides and resources on digital privacy. Ask me if you'd like me to look for specific ones.\n* **Computer Classes:** We often offer computer classes on topics like online safety and privacy. Check our schedule for upcoming classes.\n\nRemember, protecting your privacy is an ongoing process.

That's understandable, as it can be a bit tricky to navigate at first.  \n\nI can't give specific advice about your bank's particular system, as I don't have access to that information. However, I can definitely share some general tips for safe online banking that apply to most platforms:\n\n**Protecting Your Information:**\n\n* **Strong Password:** Use a unique, strong password for your online banking that's not used for any other accounts.  Consider a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  If your bank offers it, enable 2FA! This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n* **Secure Wi-Fi:**  Always access your banking information on a secure Wi-Fi network. Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions.\n* **Beware of Phishing:** Be very cautious of emails or messages asking for your banking information.  Legitimate banks will never ask for this over email or text.\n\n**Safe Browsing:**\n\n* **Look for \"https\":**  Make sure the website address starts with \"https://\" and has a padlock icon in the address bar. This indicates a secure connection.\n* **Check the Website Address:** Double-check the website address to make sure it's the correct one for your bank.  Look for typos or slight variations.\n* **Keep Software Updated:**  Keep your computer's operating system and browser updated to patch security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Monitor Your Accounts:** Regularly check your bank statements and account activity for any unauthorized transactions.\n* **Contact Your Bank:** If you have any questions or concerns about online banking security, don't hesitate to contact your bank directly. They're there to help!\n\n\nDoes any of this information seem helpful, Mary? I'm happy to explore specific aspects further if you'd like. \n\nRemember, your bank's website or customer service line is the best resource for information about your specific account and security features.",

That's a common concern, and it's great that you're taking steps to protect yourself. \n\nWhile I can't give specific financial advice, I can definitely provide some general tips for safer online banking:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords are Key:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Never use the same password for your online banking as you do for other accounts (email, social media, etc.). \n* **Length Matters:** Aim for at least 12 characters, including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate strong passwords.\n\n**2. Protect Your Devices:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your computer, tablet, and smartphone's operating system and security software up to date.\n* **Public Wi-Fi Caution:** Avoid accessing your online banking on public Wi-Fi networks unless they are secure (use \"https://\" and a padlock icon in the address bar).\n\n**3. Watch for Phishing Attempts:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails/Texts:** Be wary of emails or texts asking for your login information or account details. Banks will never ask for this information via unsolicited messages. \n* **Hover Over Links:** Before clicking on links in emails or texts, hover your mouse over them to see the actual URL. If it looks suspicious, don't click!\n\n**4. Secure Your Bank's Website:**\n\n* **https://:** Always make sure the website address starts with \"https://\" and has a padlock icon in the address bar, indicating a secure connection.\n* **Trusted Source:** Double-check the website address to ensure you're on your bank's official site, not a fake one.\n\n**5. Two-Factor Authentication:**\n\n* **Enable It:** If your bank offers two-factor authentication (2FA), enable it! This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**6. Review Your Statements Regularly:**\n\n* **Monitor Activity:**  Check your bank statements online or through paper copies regularly to catch any unauthorized transactions.\n\n\n**Local Resources:**\n\nIf you're still feeling uncomfortable or need more personalized help, I can help you find some local resources:\n\n* **Consumer Credit Counseling Service:** They offer free or low-cost financial counseling and advice.\n* **Local Senior Centers:** Many senior centers offer computer classes and tech support.\n* **Library's Digital Literacy Programs:** Check our website or ask at the information desk about any upcoming workshops on online safety or banking.\n\n\nRemember, your safety and security are paramount. Don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it.",

These often feature simple but compelling characters caught in morally ambiguous situations. \n\nHere are a few suggestions that fit your criteria and might be a good starting point:\n\n* **\"The Night Circus\" by Erin Morgenstern:** While it has a more fantastical element, this book builds a mesmerizing atmosphere with a slow-burning romance at its core. Two young magicians are pitted against each other in a secret competition, and the stakes get increasingly high. The writing is beautiful and lyrical, making it a truly immersive experience.\n\n* **\"The Big Sleep\" by Raymond Chandler:** This classic noir detective novel features the iconic Philip Marlowe. It's gritty, cynical, and full of suspense as Marlowe navigates a web of deceit and murder. Chandler's prose is sharp and witty, even in the darkest of situations.\n\n* **\"Gone Girl\" by Gillian Flynn:** This psychological thriller will keep you guessing until the very end. The story is told from alternating perspectives, and the characters are complex and unreliable. It's a dark and twisted exploration of marriage and identity.\n\n**Before you choose:** \n\n* **Check out the library's catalog:** You can search by genre, author, and reading level to find books that match your interests. \n\n* **Ask a librarian for a recommendation:** We're always happy to help you find your next great read!\n\n* **Browse the shelves:** Sometimes the best books are discovered by chance. Don't be afraid to wander and see what catches your eye.\n\n\nHappy reading!",

That's a common concern, and it's great that you're taking steps to protect yourself. \n\nWhile I can't give specific financial advice, I can definitely share some general tips for safe online banking:\n\n**Protecting Yourself:**\n\n* **Strong Passwords:** Use a unique, strong password for each of your online accounts. This means a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information like your name, birthdate, or address. \n* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Enable MFA whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n* **Beware of Phishing:** Be wary of suspicious emails or texts asking for your login information.  Banks will never ask for your password via email or text. Always log in directly through your bank's website or app.\n* **Secure Wi-Fi:** Avoid using public Wi-Fi for online banking. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection.\n* **Keep Software Updated:** Make sure your operating system, browser, and antivirus software are all up to date. Updates often include security patches that protect you from vulnerabilities.\n\n**Using Your Bank's Resources:**\n\n* **Contact Your Bank:** If you have any concerns or questions about your online banking security, don't hesitate to contact your bank directly. They are your best resource for specific guidance.\n* **Online Security Resources:** Most banks have helpful online resources and tutorials on security best practices. Check your bank's website for more information.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n* **Federal Trade Commission (FTC):** The FTC has a wealth of information on online security and fraud prevention: [https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/)\n* **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):** The CFPB offers resources on banking, including online safety tips: [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/)\n\n\nRemember, online security is an ongoing process. Stay informed and be vigilant to protect your financial information. \n\nI hope this helps, Julie! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

I can definitely help guide you through the process, but remember, I'm not a tax professional. \n\n**Here are some general steps to electronically file your taxes:**\n\n**1. Gather Your Information:**\n\n* **Personal Information:**  You'll need your Social Security Number (or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number), date of birth, and address.\n* **Income Information:**  Collect W-2s from your employer(s), 1099s for any freelance work or other income, and information about any interest or dividends you earned.\n* **Deduction and Credit Information:** Gather documentation for any deductions or credits you might be eligible for, such as student loan interest, child tax credit, or charitable contributions.\n\n**2. Choose a Filing Method:**\n\n* **Tax Preparation Software:**  Popular options include TurboTax, H&R Block, and TaxAct. These programs guide you through the process step-by-step and often offer free versions for simple tax situations.\n* **Free File:** The IRS offers Free File, a program that provides free tax preparation and filing software for taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes below certain limits. You can access it through the IRS website (www.irs.gov).\n* **Paid Tax Professional:**  If your taxes are complex, consider hiring a certified public accountant (CPA) or enrolled agent (EA) for assistance.\n\n**3. Create an Account:**\n\n* If you're using tax software or Free File, you'll need to create an account with the provider.\n\n**4. Enter Your Information:**\n\n* Carefully enter all your personal, income, and deduction/credit information into the software. Double-check everything for accuracy.\n\n**5. Review and File:**\n\n* Before filing, thoroughly review your tax return for any errors. Once you're confident everything is correct, electronically file your return.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* I can help you find free tax preparation assistance through the IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program or Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) program. These programs offer free tax help to eligible individuals.\n* We also have books and online resources on tax preparation available for you to use.\n\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **File on time!** The tax deadline is typically April 15th each year.\n* **Keep copies of everything!** Save printed or digital copies of your tax return, supporting documentation, and any correspondence with the IRS.\n\nI hope this helps, Theodore.

Libraries are excellent resources for finding trustworthy information, and I'm happy to help guide you. \n\nHere are some excellent starting points for finding information on consumer rights:\n\n**Government Agencies:**\n\n* **Federal Trade Commission (FTC):** The FTC is a great resource for general consumer protection information, covering topics like identity theft, online shopping, and advertising.  You can find their website at [https://www.ftc.gov/](https://www.ftc.gov/).\n* **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):** This agency focuses specifically on financial products and services, offering guidance on mortgages, credit cards, loans, and more. Their website is [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/).\n* **Your State Attorney General's Office:**  Each state has an Attorney General who protects consumers within their state. They often have specific resources and guidance on issues relevant to your location. You can find your state's Attorney General's website through a quick online search.\n\n**Non-Profit Organizations:**\n\n* **Consumer Reports:**  This independent organization provides unbiased reviews and ratings of products and services, as well as consumer advocacy resources.  Their website is [https://www.consumerreports.org/](https://www.consumerreports.org/). \n* **National Consumer Law Center (NCLC):**  The NCLC focuses on legal issues affecting consumers, offering in-depth information and resources on a variety of topics. Their website is [https://www.nclc.org/](https://www.nclc.org/).\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Be specific in your search terms:** When searching online, use specific keywords related to your consumer rights question. For example, instead of \"consumer rights,\" try \"consumer rights for online purchases\" or \"complaining about a faulty product.\"\n* **Check the source:**  Always evaluate the credibility of the website you're using. Look for .gov, .org, or .edu domain names, and be wary of websites that seem biased or promotional.\n* **Don't hesitate to ask:** If you have any further questions or need help navigating these resources, please don't hesitate to ask! I'm here to assist you.\n\n\nI hope this helps, Victoria! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

Secure Your Device:**\n\n* **Strong Passwords:** Use a unique, strong password for your online banking account. This should be a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information like your birthday or address. Consider a password manager to help you create and store strong passwords securely.\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your computer, smartphone, and operating systems updated with the latest security patches.\n* **Antivirus Protection:** Install reputable antivirus and anti-malware software and keep it updated.\n\n**2. Protect Your Connection:**\n\n* **Public Wi-Fi Caution:** Avoid accessing your online banking on public Wi-Fi networks unless they are secured with a VPN (Virtual Private Network). Public Wi-Fi can be vulnerable to hackers.\n* **Secure Website:** Always ensure you're on your bank's official website by checking the URL. Look for \"https://\" and a padlock icon in the address bar, indicating a secure connection.\n\n**3. Be Aware of Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails/Texts:** Be wary of emails or text messages asking for your personal or financial information. Banks will never ask for this information via email or text.\n* **Hover over Links:** Before clicking on any links in emails or messages, hover your mouse over them to see the actual URL. If it looks suspicious, don't click.\n\n**4. Monitor Your Accounts:**\n\n* **Regularly Check Statements:** Review your bank statements and online account activity frequently for any unauthorized transactions.\n\n**5. Contact Your Bank:**\n\n* **Report Suspicious Activity:** If you notice anything suspicious, contact your bank immediately.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\nI can also point you to some helpful resources at the library:\n\n* **Computer Classes:** We offer classes on digital literacy, including online safety and security.\n* **Consumer Protection Information:** Our reference librarians can help you find information about consumer protection and online fraud.\n\nRemember, your safety is paramount.

That's a very important topic! \n\nWhile I can't give specific advice about your particular bank's website, I can share some general tips for staying safe while banking online:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:** Use a different, strong password for each of your online accounts. \n* **Password Strength:** Make your passwords at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to help you create and store strong, unique passwords. \n\n**2. Secure Connections:**\n\n* **Look for \"https\":**  Make sure the website address starts with \"https://\" and has a padlock icon in the address bar. This indicates a secure connection.\n* **Avoid Public Wi-Fi:**  Don't access your bank account on public Wi-Fi networks, as they can be less secure.\n\n**3. Phishing Scams:**\n\n* **Beware of suspicious emails or texts:**  Don't click on links or open attachments in emails or texts from unknown senders. Banks will never ask for your password or account information via email or text.\n* **Verify Requests:** If you receive a request for information that seems suspicious, contact your bank directly using a known phone number or website address.\n\n**4. Multi-Factor Authentication:**\n\n* **Enable It:** Many banks offer multi-factor authentication (MFA), which requires you to enter a code from your phone or email in addition to your password. This adds an extra layer of security.\n\n**5. Keep Software Updated:**\n\n* **Updates Protect:**  Make sure your computer's operating system and web browser are up to date. Updates often include security patches.\n\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\nHere at the library, we have resources that can help you learn more about online safety and digital literacy:\n\n* **Computer Training:** We offer free computer classes on various topics, including online safety.\n* **Books and Websites:** We have books and online resources available that provide information about online security and protecting yourself from scams.\n\n**Additional Help:**\n\n* **Your Bank:** Don't hesitate to contact your bank directly if you have any questions or concerns about online banking security.\n* **Consumer Protection Agencies:** You can also reach out to consumer protection agencies for assistance with online security issues.\n\nRemember, staying safe online is an ongoing process. By following these tips and using the resources available to you, you can protect yourself from online threats.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with today, Steven?",

The prose is beautiful and intricate.\n\nRemember, these are just starting points.  \n\nTo help me narrow it down further, could you tell me:\n\n* **Are there any particular genres you're interested in?** (e.g., fantasy, literary fiction, historical fiction)\n* **Are there any themes that particularly resonate with you?** (e.g., love, loss, identity, social justice)\n\n\nI'm here to help you find the perfect book for your next immersive reading experience!",

It's always best to consult your bank's website or contact their customer service for personalized help.\n\nHere are some general safety tips for online banking:\n\n**Protecting Your Device:**\n\n* **Use strong passwords:** Make sure your password is at least 12 characters long, includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and isn't something easily guessable.\n* **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA):** This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password. Most banks offer this now.\n* **Keep your software updated:** Regularly update your operating system and web browser to patch security vulnerabilities.\n* **Use a secure Wi-Fi network:** Avoid using public Wi-Fi for online banking, as it can be less secure.\n\n**Protecting Yourself from Phishing:**\n\n* **Be wary of suspicious emails and links:** Don't click on links or open attachments in emails from unknown senders, even if they appear to be from your bank.\n* **Double-check website addresses:** Make sure you're on your bank's official website by looking for the \"https://\" and a padlock icon in the address bar.\n* **Never share personal information:** Don't give out your account number, password, or other sensitive information over the phone or email unless you initiated the contact and are sure you're talking to a legitimate representative.\n\n**Other Tips:**\n\n* **Monitor your accounts regularly:** Check your bank statements and online account activity frequently for any suspicious transactions.\n* **Set up alerts:** Many banks offer alerts for account activity, low balances, or unusual transactions.\n* **Contact your bank if you have any concerns:** If you notice anything suspicious or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your bank directly.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or need help finding more specific information about online banking safety.

It's important for everyone to be mindful of their digital footprint. \n\nLet's talk about some steps you can take to enhance your online privacy.  \n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:** Use a different, strong password for each of your online accounts. A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. \n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager like LastPass or 1Password. They securely store your passwords and can generate strong, unique ones for you.\n\n**2. Secure Browsing:**\n\n* **HTTPS:** Always look for the \"https://\" in the address bar of the websites you visit. This \"s\" stands for secure, meaning your information is encrypted.\n* **VPN:** A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic and masks your IP address, making it more difficult for others to track your online activity. There are free and paid VPN options available.\n\n**3. Social Media Settings:**\n\n* **Privacy Settings:** Review the privacy settings on your social media accounts and limit who can see your posts, photos, and other information. \n* **Think Before You Post:** Be mindful of what you share online. Remember that once something is posted, it can be difficult to remove completely.\n\n**4. Email Security:**\n\n* **Be Cautious of Phishing:** Don't click on links or open attachments from unknown senders. Phishing emails are designed to steal your personal information.\n* **Use Two-Factor Authentication:** Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your email account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone in addition to your password.\n\n**5. Device Security:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your operating system and software up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.\n* **Antivirus Protection:** Use a reputable antivirus program to protect your devices from malware.\n\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **The Federal Trade Commission (FTC):** [https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/) \n* **Privacy Rights Clearinghouse:** [https://privacyrights.org/](https://privacyrights.org/)\n\nRemember, protecting your privacy online is an ongoing process.

That's a common concern, and it's great that you're taking steps to protect yourself. \n\nI can't give specific advice on your bank's platform since I don't have access to it, but I can share some general best practices for safe online banking:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:** Use a different, strong password for each online account, especially your bank.\n* **Password Strength:** Make your passwords at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. \n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate strong passwords.\n\n**2. Secure Connection:**\n\n* **HTTPS:** Always make sure the website address starts with \"https://\" and has a padlock symbol in the address bar. This indicates a secure connection.\n* **Public Wi-Fi Caution:** Avoid accessing your online banking on public Wi-Fi networks unless you're using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to encrypt your connection.\n\n**3. Be Wary of Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails and Links:**  Be cautious of emails or messages asking for personal information like your username, password, or account number. Never click on links in suspicious emails.\n* **Verify Directly:** If you receive a request for information, verify it directly with your bank through a known phone number or website.\n\n**4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**\n\n* **Enable MFA:**  Turn on MFA whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**5. Regular Monitoring:**\n\n* **Check Account Statements:** Regularly review your bank statements for any unauthorized transactions.\n* **Report Suspicious Activity:** Contact your bank immediately if you notice any unusual activity.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* **Cybersecurity Workshops:** Check our events calendar for upcoming cybersecurity workshops or online resources on digital safety.\n* **Computer Classes:** We offer classes on various computer skills, including online safety and security.\n* **Reference Assistance:** Our librarians are happy to answer your questions about online banking and provide guidance on finding reliable information.\n\n\nRemember, if you have any doubts or concerns, it's always best to contact your bank directly for assistance. \n\nIs there anything specific about online banking that you're struggling with? I might be able to provide more tailored advice.",

These often have free versions for simple tax situations, or paid versions for more complex ones.\n* **Tax Preparation Professional:** If you have a complex tax situation or prefer professional assistance, consider hiring a certified public accountant (CPA) or enrolled agent (EA).\n\n**3.

It plays with familiar tropes of marriage and mystery, but with a chilling and unpredictable edge.\n\n* **\"The Silent Patient\" by Alex Michaelides:** This psychological thriller features a mute woman who has been accused of murdering her husband, and a therapist determined to uncover her secrets.  The writing is captivating, and the tension builds steadily throughout.\n\nIf you're open to something a little different, but still within that suspenseful realm, consider:\n\n* **\"The Guest List\" by Lucy Foley:** This locked-room mystery takes place on a remote island during a lavish wedding.  Secrets and tensions simmer beneath the surface, leading to a shocking climax. It's a great choice if you like a bit of social commentary woven into your thriller.\n\nFor a more literary feel, try:\n\n* **\"The Girl on the Train\" by Paula Hawkins:** This novel uses multiple perspectives to tell a story of obsession, memory, and unreliable narration. The writing is atmospheric and evocative, drawing you into the protagonist's troubled mind.\n\n\nTo help me narrow down the options further, tell me:\n\n* **What kind of setting are you looking for?** (modern day, historical, fantasy, etc.)\n* **Are there any themes or topics that particularly interest you?** (psychological suspense, crime, family secrets, etc.)\n\n\n\nI'm here to help you find the perfect book!",

The sparse language and detached narrator create a chillingly immersive experience. \n* **\"The Sound and the Fury\" by William Faulkner:** This complex, multi-layered novel delves into the decline of a Southern family. The narrative shifts between different perspectives, each with its own unique voice and style, offering a fragmented and haunting portrait of human relationships.\n\n**Modern Authors with a Similar Style:**\n\n* **\"The Road\" by Cormac McCarthy:** Set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, this bleak but powerful novel follows a father and son as they journey across a desolate landscape. McCarthy's sparse prose and bleak imagery create a gripping and unforgettable reading experience.\n* **\"A Long Petal of the Sea\" by Isabel Allende:** While Allende's writing is known for its lyrical beauty, this novel, set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War and Chilean exile, delves into themes of loss, love, and the human cost of conflict. It's a powerful and deeply moving story with complex characters.\n\n**Something a Little Different:**\n\n* **\"The Vegetarian\" by Han Kang:** This unsettling and poetic novel follows a woman who decides to become a vegetarian, sparking a chain of disturbing events. The minimalist prose and dreamlike atmosphere create a truly unique and unforgettable reading experience.\n\nI encourage you to browse the library's collection and read the synopses and reviews to find the perfect book for you.

However, I can definitely share some general tips for safe online banking:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:** Use a different, strong password for each of your online accounts. \n* **Length and Complexity:**  Aim for at least 12 characters, mixing uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate strong passwords.\n\n**2. Secure Connections:**\n\n* **HTTPS:** Always look for the \"https://\" in the website address and a padlock icon in the browser address bar. This indicates a secure connection.\n* **Public Wi-Fi:** Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for online banking, as they can be less secure.\n\n**3. Be Wary of Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails:** Don't click on links or open attachments in emails from unknown senders, even if they appear to be from your bank.\n* **Phone Scams:** Be cautious of phone calls from people claiming to be from your bank asking for personal information. Hang up and contact your bank directly using a known number.\n\n**4. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**\n\n* **Enable 2FA:**  Whenever possible, enable 2FA. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or another device in addition to your password.\n\n**5. Regular Monitoring:**\n\n* **Check Statements:** Review your bank statements regularly for any unauthorized transactions.\n* **Credit Reports:** Check your credit reports from all three credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) annually for any suspicious activity.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\nThe library has many resources that can help you with digital literacy and online safety:\n\n* **Computer Classes:** We offer classes on a variety of computer skills, including online banking.\n* **Internet Access:** You can use our computers and secure Wi-Fi to access your online banking safely.\n* **Reference Librarians:** We can answer your questions about online safety and provide you with additional resources.\n\n\nIf you have any specific questions about your bank's website or online banking system, I recommend contacting your bank directly.

That's a common concern, and it's great that you're taking steps to protect yourself. \n\nWhile I can't give specific advice about your bank's system, I can share some general tips for safe online banking:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords are Key:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:** Use a different, strong password for each of your online accounts, including your bank. \n* **Password Strength:**  Make your passwords at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.  \n\n**2. Secure Your Device:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your computer, tablet, or smartphone's operating system and security software up to date.\n* **Public Wi-Fi Caution:** Avoid doing online banking on public Wi-Fi networks whenever possible. They're often unsecured and could expose your information. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for an extra layer of protection.\n\n**3. Recognize Phishing Attempts:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails/Texts:** Be wary of unexpected emails or texts asking for your login information or other personal details.  Legitimate banks will never ask for this information via email or text.\n* **Hover Over Links:** Before clicking on any links in an email or text, hover your mouse over them to see the full URL. If it looks suspicious or doesn't match the official bank website, don't click it.\n\n**4. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**\n\n* **Enable 2FA:** If your bank offers two-factor authentication, enable it! This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**5. Monitor your Accounts:**\n\n* **Regularly Check Statements:** Review your bank statements carefully for any unauthorized transactions. Report any suspicious activity to your bank immediately.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* **Computer Classes:** Check our website or ask at the front desk about upcoming computer classes. We often have classes on online safety and banking.\n* **Digital Literacy Resources:** We have books, websites, and other resources on digital literacy that can help you learn more about online security.\n\n\nRemember, if you're ever unsure about something, it's always best to contact your bank directly through their official phone number or website. \n\nI hope this helps, Emily! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

It sounds like you're looking for a book that's intellectually stimulating but also a page-turner. \n\nGiven your preferences, I'd recommend exploring the works of authors known for their concise prose and thought-provoking themes. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n**Minimalist Style with Depth:**\n\n* **\"The Road\" by Cormac McCarthy:**  This post-apocalyptic novel is bleak but beautiful in its simplicity. The language is spare, focusing on the raw emotions and bond between a father and son in a desolate world. It explores themes of survival, hope, and the nature of humanity.\n* **\"The Stranger\" by Albert Camus:** This existentialist classic follows Meursault, a detached man whose actions lead to a murder trial. The story is simple, but the philosophical questions it raises about meaning, purpose, and justice are profound.\n* **\"A Visit from the Goon Squad\" by Jennifer Egan:** This Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is structured in interconnected stories spanning decades. While the language isn't minimalist, Egan's writing is precise and impactful, exploring themes of time, memory, and the music industry.\n\n**Fast-Paced with Philosophical Undertones:**\n\n* **\"Gone Girl\" by Gillian Flynn:** This psychological thriller is a wild ride with twists and turns that will keep you guessing. Beneath the suspense, it delves into the complexities of marriage, perception, and truth.\n* **\"The Girl on the Train\" by Paula Hawkins:** Another gripping thriller, this one explores themes of obsession, memory, and unreliable narration. It's a page-turner with a thought-provoking element of psychological suspense.\n\nI encourage you to browse these authors and see what catches your eye. Remember, the library has a wealth of resources beyond just books, including e-books, audiobooks, and online databases. Don't hesitate to ask if you need help finding something specific or exploring a particular topic. Happy reading!",

    "response": "Hi Shane,\n\nI understand you're having trouble with online banking safely.  It's great that you're taking steps to protect yourself! \n\nI can't give specific advice about your bank's system since I don't have access to that information. However, I can give you some general tips for safe online banking:\n\n**Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:** Use a different, strong password for each of your online accounts. \n* **Password Strength:** Make your passwords at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to help you create and store strong, unique passwords.\n\n**Secure Connections:**\n\n* **Look for \"https\":**  Always make sure the website address starts with \"https\" and has a padlock icon in the address bar. This indicates a secure connection.\n* **Avoid Public Wi-Fi:** Be very careful about using public Wi-Fi for online banking. Hackers can sometimes intercept information sent over unsecured networks.\n\n**Protecting Your Device:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your computer, phone, and tablet updated with the latest security patches.\n* **Antivirus Software:** Use reputable antivirus software and keep it up to date.\n\n**Be Aware of Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails:**  Be wary of emails asking for your personal information.  Never click on links in unsolicited emails, especially if they claim to be from your bank.\n* **Official Contact:** If you receive an email that seems suspicious, contact your bank directly using the phone number on their official website to verify.\n\n**Two-Factor Authentication:**\n\n* **Enable 2FA:**  If your bank offers two-factor authentication (2FA), enable it! 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**Review Your Statements:**\n\n* **Regular Checking:**  Check your bank statements regularly for any unauthorized transactions. Report any suspicious activity to your bank immediately.\n\n\n**For More Help:**\n\n* **Your Bank:** Your bank's website or call center is the best resource for specific information about their online banking security measures.\n* **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:**  The CFPB offers helpful resources on online banking safety: [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/)\n\nRemember, it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your finances. Don't hesitate to ask your bank for help if you have any questions or concerns. \n\nI hope this helps, Shane! Please let me know if you have any other questions.",

Online banking can be very convenient, but it's important to keep your information secure. \n\nI can't give specific advice about your bank's website since I don't have access to that information, but I can offer some general tips for safe online banking:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:** Use a different, strong password for each of your online accounts. A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. \n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to help you create and store strong, unique passwords.\n\n**2. Secure Connection:**\n\n* **Look for \"https\":** Before entering any personal information, make sure the website address starts with \"https://\" and has a padlock icon in the address bar. This indicates a secure connection.\n\n**3. Public Wi-Fi Caution:**\n\n* **Avoid Public Wi-Fi:**  Try to avoid using public Wi-Fi networks (like at cafes or libraries) for online banking. Public Wi-Fi can be less secure, making your information more vulnerable.\n\n**4. Device Security:**\n\n* **Keep Software Updated:** Make sure your computer, tablet, or phone has the latest software updates. Updates often include security patches that protect against known vulnerabilities.\n* **Antivirus Software:** Use reputable antivirus software and keep it updated to protect your device from malware.\n\n**5. Phishing Awareness:**\n\n* **Be Wary of Emails and Texts:** Don't click on links or open attachments in emails or texts from unknown senders. Legitimate banks will never ask for your personal information via email or text.\n\n**6. Bank's Security Features:**\n\n* **Two-Factor Authentication:** Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n* **Review Statements Regularly:** Check your bank statements regularly for any unauthorized transactions.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **Your Bank's Website:** Your bank's website likely has a section dedicated to online banking security with specific tips and instructions. \n* **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB):** The CFPB has helpful resources on online banking safety: [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/)\n\nRemember, if you ever feel unsure about something, it's always best to contact your bank directly through their official phone number or website. They're there to help!\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.",

    "response": "Hi Cleo, thanks for coming in! I understand you're concerned about your online privacy, and that's a really important topic these days.  I can definitely help you understand some steps you can take to protect yourself.\n\nLet's break it down into manageable steps:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Use a different, strong password for each online account. A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate these complex passwords. There are several free and paid options available. \n\n**2.  Public Wi-Fi Caution:**\n\n* **Avoid Sensitive Activities:**  Don't do anything requiring sensitive information (like online banking or shopping) on public Wi-Fi networks. These networks are often unsecured, meaning your data could be intercepted.\n* **VPN:** When using public Wi-Fi, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) can encrypt your internet traffic and add an extra layer of security. \n\n**3. Be Mindful of What You Share:**\n\n* **Social Media:** Think carefully about what personal information you share on social media.  Limit what you post publicly, and review your privacy settings.\n* **Email:** Be cautious about opening emails from unknown senders and clicking on links within them. They could contain malware.\n\n**4. Software Updates:**\n\n* **Keep Software Updated:** Regularly update your operating system, web browser, and other software. These updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities.\n\n**5. Two-Factor Authentication:**\n\n* **Enable 2FA:** Whenever possible, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone.\n\n**6. Privacy Settings:**\n\n* **Review Privacy Settings:** Regularly review the privacy settings on your devices and apps.  Customize them to control what data is collected and shared.\n\n**7. Be Aware of Phishing:**\n\n* **Spot Phishing Attempts:** Be wary of emails, texts, or websites that try to trick you into revealing personal information (like passwords or credit card numbers).\n\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* We have several resources here at the library that can provide more in-depth information on online privacy and security.\n* Check out books on the topic, or ask me about our online databases that offer cybersecurity tips and tutorials.\n\n\nRemember, protecting your online privacy is an ongoing process. Stay informed, be cautious, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any more questions.",

It's more important than ever in today's digital world. \n\nHere are some steps you can take to improve your online privacy:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Use strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts. A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. \n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to help you create and store strong, unique passwords. \n\n* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.\n\n**2. Be Careful What You Share:**\n\n* **Social Media:** Be mindful of the information you share on social media. Avoid oversharing personal details like your address, phone number, or birthdate. Review your privacy settings regularly to control who can see your posts and information.\n* **Public Wi-Fi:** Be cautious about using public Wi-Fi networks for sensitive activities like online banking or shopping. These networks are often unsecured, making your data vulnerable to interception.\n\n**3. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your operating system, web browser, and other software up to date. Updates often include security patches that fix vulnerabilities.\n* **Firewall:** Ensure your computer has a firewall enabled to help block unauthorized access.\n* **Antivirus Software:** Use reputable antivirus software to protect your devices from malware and other threats.\n\n**4. Privacy Settings:**\n\n* **Browser Settings:** Review your browser's privacy settings. You can often control things like cookies, tracking, and website permissions.\n* **App Permissions:** Pay attention to the permissions you grant to apps when you install them. Only allow access to the information they absolutely need to function.\n\n**5. Be Aware of Phishing Scams:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails:** Be wary of emails from unknown senders or those that ask for personal information.\n* **Clicking Links Carefully:** Don't click on links in emails or messages unless you are sure they are legitimate. Hover over the link to see the actual URL before clicking.\n\n**6. Consider a VPN:**\n\n* **Virtual Private Network (VPN):** A VPN encrypts your internet traffic and masks your IP address, making it more difficult for others to track your online activity.\n\n**7. Regularly Review Your Privacy:**\n\n* **Check Accounts:** Periodically review your privacy settings on social media and other online accounts.\n* **Data Breaches:** Stay informed about data breaches and take steps to protect your information if your data has been compromised.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* **The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF):** [https://www.eff.org/](https://www.eff.org/)\n* **The Federal Trade Commission (FTC):** [https://www.ftc.gov/](https://www.ftc.gov/)\n* **Consumer Reports:** [https://www.consumerreports.org/](https://www.consumerreports.org/)\n\n\nRemember, protecting your privacy online is an ongoing process.

That's a common concern, and I'm happy to help walk you through some best practices. \n\nRemember, I can't give specific advice about your bank's system, as I don't have access to that information. However, I can provide you with general guidelines that apply to most online banking platforms. \n\nHere are some key steps to keep your online banking secure:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique and Complex:** Use a unique, strong password for your online banking that is different from any other accounts.  A strong password should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate strong passwords.\n\n**2. Secure Connection:**\n\n* **HTTPS:** Always ensure you're accessing your bank's website through a secure connection. Look for \"https://\" in the web address and a padlock icon in your browser's address bar.\n* **Public Wi-Fi Caution:** Avoid accessing your bank account on public Wi-Fi networks unless you're using a virtual private network (VPN).\n\n**3. Phishing Awareness:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails/Texts:** Be wary of unsolicited emails or text messages requesting your banking information. Banks will never ask for your password or account details via email or text.\n* **Verify Requests:** If you receive a questionable request, contact your bank directly using a known phone number or website to verify its legitimacy.\n\n**4. Two-Factor Authentication:**\n\n* **Enable It:** If your bank offers two-factor authentication (2FA), enable it! This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.\n\n**5. Regular Checks:**\n\n* **Account Activity:** Review your bank account statements and transaction history regularly for any unauthorized activity.\n* **Security Settings:** Update your security settings and preferences as needed, such as changing your password periodically.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\nI know the library can be a great resource for learning more about online safety. We offer:\n\n* **Computer classes:** We often have classes on topics like internet safety and online banking. Check our website or ask at the information desk for upcoming schedules.\n* **Internet access:** You can access the internet safely and securely at the library.\n* **Resources and guides:** We have books, pamphlets, and online resources on various technology topics, including online security.\n\n\nPlease don't hesitate to ask if you have any other questions. I'm here to help you navigate the digital world safely and confidently.",

Their website will have information specific to your state laws and resources.\n\n**Non-Profit Organizations:**\n\n* **Consumer Reports:** This independent, non-profit organization provides unbiased reviews and ratings of products and services, as well as information about consumer rights.

Let me see what I can find for you, Barbara. \n\nSince you're looking for something slow-paced and immersive with simple characters, I'd recommend steering clear of complex fantasy epics or sprawling sagas. Instead, we might look at:\n\n* **Gothic Horror:** This genre often features isolated settings, dark secrets, and a slow build-up of tension. Some authors known for this style include Shirley Jackson (\"The Haunting of Hill House\") and Sarah Waters (\"Fingersmith\"). \n\n* **Southern Gothic:** This subgenre blends elements of horror with social commentary, often exploring themes of family, race, and history.  Authors like Flannery O'Connor (\"Wise Blood\") and Cormac McCarthy (\"Child of God\") are masters of this style.\n\n* **Psychological Thriller:**  These books delve into the minds of their characters, often using suspense and twists to keep the reader on edge.  Try Gillian Flynn (\"Gone Girl\") or Paula Hawkins (\"The Girl on the Train\").\n\nI'll need to know a bit more about your specific interests to narrow it down further. \n\nFor example:\n\n* **What kind of \"action\" are you looking for?**  Physical violence, psychological manipulation, suspenseful chases?\n* **Are there any particular themes or topics you're interested in?**  Family, revenge, isolation, social injustice?\n* **Are there any authors or books you've enjoyed in the past that have a similar feel?**\n\n\nKnowing more about your taste will help me find the perfect immersive and intense read for you!",

That's very common, and it's great that you're taking steps to protect yourself! \n\nWhile I can't give specific financial advice, I can definitely walk you through some general safety tips for online banking:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique and Complex:** Use a different, strong password for your online banking than any other account. \n* **Length Matters:** Aim for at least 12 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to store your passwords securely.\n\n**2. Secure Connection:**\n\n* **Look for \"https\":** Always make sure the website address starts with \"https://\" and has a padlock icon in the address bar. This indicates a secure connection.\n* **Public Wi-Fi Caution:** Avoid using public Wi-Fi for online banking if possible. If you must, use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection.\n\n**3. Phishing Awareness:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails/Texts:** Be wary of emails or texts asking for your personal information or login credentials. Banks will never ask for this information via email or text.\n* **Hover Over Links:** Before clicking on links in emails or texts, hover your mouse over them to see the actual URL. If it looks suspicious, don't click.\n\n**4. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**\n\n* **Enable MFA:**  Most banks offer MFA, which adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password. Enable this feature whenever possible.\n\n**5. Regular Review:**\n\n* **Statement Review:**  Check your bank statements regularly for any unauthorized transactions.\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your computer and mobile device software up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* **Free Computer Access:** We offer free computer access and Wi-Fi for all library patrons. You can use our computers to access your online banking securely.\n* **Digital Literacy Classes:** We offer classes on various digital literacy topics, including online safety and security. Check our website or ask a librarian for more details.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Contact Your Bank:** If you have any concerns or questions about your online banking security, don't hesitate to contact your bank directly.

Coelho's writing is beautifully simple and poetic, making it a quick and engaging read.\n\n**2. _Siddhartha_ by Hermann Hesse:** This novel is a spiritual journey of self-discovery. Siddhartha, a young man in ancient India, seeks enlightenment through various paths, encountering mentors and challenges along the way. Like _The Alchemist_, it explores themes of love, loss, and the search for meaning in life. Hesse's prose is lyrical and evocative.\n\n**3. _The Book Thief_ by Markus Zusak:**  This story, narrated by Death, follows a young girl in Nazi Germany who finds solace in stolen books.  While the historical setting is quite serious, the narrative is infused with a sense of wonder and hope. Zusak's writing is both poetic and deeply affecting.\n\n**4. _Life of Pi_ by Yann Martel:** This imaginative story combines adventure and philosophical exploration.  A young boy survives a shipwreck and finds himself adrift on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger.  Martel's prose is stunningly beautiful, and the story raises profound questions about faith, storytelling, and the power of the human spirit.\n\n**Connecting You to Resources:**\n\nI encourage you to browse our library's collection online or visit us in person.

It's more important than ever in today's digital world.\n\nI can definitely help guide you through some steps you can take. \n\nLet's start with the basics:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Use a different, strong password for each online account. A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to help you create and store strong, unique passwords. This tool will securely generate and remember them for you. \n\n**2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**\n\n* **Enable 2FA:**  Whenever possible, enable two-factor authentication on your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**3. Be Careful What You Share:**\n\n* **Think Before You Post:**  Be mindful of what personal information you share online, especially on social media. Avoid posting your full address, phone number, birthdate, or other sensitive details publicly.\n* **Review Privacy Settings:** Regularly review the privacy settings on your social media accounts and other online platforms. Adjust them to control who can see your information.\n\n**4. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your operating system, apps, and browsers updated with the latest security patches.\n* **Antivirus Software:** Use reliable antivirus software to protect your devices from malware.\n* **Public Wi-Fi:** Be cautious about using public Wi-Fi networks, as they can be less secure. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection.\n\n**5. Phishing Awareness:**\n\n* **Be Suspicious:** Be wary of suspicious emails, texts, or phone calls asking for personal information. Legitimate organizations will not typically ask for sensitive data via these channels. \n* **Check URLs:** Carefully examine email addresses and website URLs to ensure they are legitimate.\n\n**Resources:**\n\nI can also connect you with some excellent online resources that provide more detailed information about online privacy:\n\n* **The Federal Trade Commission (FTC):** [https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/) \n* **The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF):** [https://www.eff.org/](https://www.eff.org/)\n* **Privacy Rights Clearinghouse:** [https://privacyrights.org/](https://privacyrights.org/)\n\n\nRemember, protecting your privacy online is an ongoing process.  \n\nAre there any specific areas you'd like to focus on or any questions you have about these steps?

It's important for everyone. \n\nProtecting your privacy online can feel overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be. Let's break it down into manageable steps:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Use a different, strong password for every account. A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. \n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to help you create and store strong, unique passwords. They can even autofill them for you.\n\n**2. Be Cautious What You Share:**\n\n* **Think Before You Post:**  Ask yourself if you're comfortable with something you're about to post being public forever. Once it's online, it can be difficult to remove.\n* **Limit Personal Information:** Avoid sharing sensitive information like your full address, phone number, birthdate, or financial details on social media or public websites unless you're on a secure site (look for \"https\" in the address bar).\n* **Privacy Settings:** Review the privacy settings on your social media accounts and adjust them to control who can see your posts and information.\n\n**3. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Software Updates:** Keep your operating system, apps, and browser updated. These updates often include security patches that protect against known vulnerabilities.\n* **Firewall:**  Make sure your computer has a firewall enabled. A firewall acts as a barrier between your computer and the internet, blocking unauthorized access.\n* **Antivirus Software:** Install reputable antivirus software and keep it updated to protect against malware and viruses.\n\n**4. Be Aware of Phishing Scams:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails & Links:** Be cautious of emails or links from unknown senders. Don't click on links or open attachments unless you're sure they are legitimate.\n* **Verify Requests:** If you receive a request for personal information, verify its legitimacy by contacting the organization directly through a known and trusted channel.\n\n**5. Secure Public Wi-Fi:**\n\n* **Use VPN:** When using public Wi-Fi, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, making it more secure.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* **Free Online Privacy Courses:** The library offers free online courses on digital literacy and online safety. These courses can provide more in-depth information on protecting your privacy.\n* **Computer Labs:** Our computer labs have secure internet access and software to help you protect your privacy.\n* **Librarians:** We are here to help! Feel free to ask us any questions you have about online privacy.\n\n\nRemember, protecting your privacy online is an ongoing process.

That's a common concern, and I'm happy to help guide you through some best practices.  \n\nRemember, I can't give specific advice about your bank's website or app, as security measures vary. However, here are some general tips to keep your finances safe online:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Use a different, strong password for each of your online accounts, including your bank.\n* **Password Strength:** Aim for at least 12 characters, a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. \n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate strong passwords.\n\n**2. Secure Connections:**\n\n* **Look for \"https\":** Always make sure you're on a secure website by checking for \"https\" in the web address and a padlock icon in the address bar. This indicates encryption, which protects your information.\n* **Public Wi-Fi Caution:** Avoid accessing your bank account on public Wi-Fi networks whenever possible. They can be less secure.\n\n**3. Watch for Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails/Texts:** Be wary of emails or texts asking for your login information or personal details. Your bank will never ask for this via email or text. \n* **Verify Links:** Hover over links in emails or texts before clicking them to ensure they lead to the legitimate bank website.\n\n**4. Two-Factor Authentication:**\n\n* **Enable It:**  Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**5. Keep Software Updated:**\n\n* **Operating System:** Make sure your computer's operating system and web browser are up to date with the latest security patches.\n\n**6. Review Statements Regularly:**\n\n* **Check for Errors:** Examine your bank statements carefully for any unauthorized transactions. Report any discrepancies to your bank immediately.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\nThe library can be a great resource for learning more about online safety!\n\n* **Computer Classes:** We often offer classes on digital literacy, including topics like online banking and cybersecurity. Check our schedule or website for upcoming classes.\n* **Online Resources:** Many reputable websites provide free information on online safety. I can help you find some reliable sources.\n\n\nRemember, if you're ever unsure about something, it's always best to contact your bank directly through their official website or phone number. \n\nI hope this helps, Bryce! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

These often feature relatable characters facing moral dilemmas or unraveling unsettling truths, and the pacing can be quite slow and deliberate, allowing for deep character exploration.\n\nHere are a few suggestions:\n\n* **\"The Silent Patient\" by Alex Michaelides:**  This book centers around a mute woman who has been accused of murdering her husband, and the therapist determined to uncover her secrets.  It has a captivating mystery, twists you won't see coming, and is written in a very engaging, conversational style.\n\n* **\"The Guest List\" by Lucy Foley:**  Set on a remote island during a lavish wedding celebration, this story unfolds from multiple perspectives, each revealing secrets and hidden tensions.  The atmosphere is thick with suspense, and the characters, while archetypal, are complex enough to keep you guessing until the very end.\n\n* **\"Verity\" by Colleen Hoover:** A struggling writer takes on the task of finishing the manuscript of a successful author who is injured. As she delves deeper into the author's work, she uncovers disturbing secrets that blur the lines between reality and fiction.\n\nIf you're open to exploring other genres, I could also suggest some **domestic suspense** or **gothic mystery** novels that might fit your criteria.\n\nDo any of these sound intriguing?

It's a bit like a multi-layered shield, and we'll go through each layer:\n\n**1. Strong Passwords:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Use a different, strong password for each of your online accounts.  A strong password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n* **Password Manager:** Consider using a password manager to store and generate your passwords securely. This way, you don't have to remember them all.\n\n**2. Phishing Awareness:**\n\n* **Be Cautious of Emails and Links:** Don't click on links or open attachments in emails from unknown senders. Be wary of emails asking for personal information. Legitimate organizations rarely ask for sensitive data via email.\n* **Hover Over Links:** Before clicking, hover your mouse over a link to see the actual URL. If it looks suspicious, don't click!\n\n**3. Social Media Privacy:**\n\n* **Review Privacy Settings:** Regularly check and adjust your privacy settings on social media platforms. Limit who can see your posts, photos, and personal information.\n* **Think Before You Post:** Be mindful of what you share online. Once something is posted, it can be difficult to remove completely.\n\n**4. Secure Your Devices:**\n\n* **Keep Software Updated:** Always install the latest security updates for your operating system, apps, and browser. These updates often include patches for vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.\n* **Use Antivirus Software:** Install reputable antivirus software and keep it updated to protect your devices from malware.\n* **Strong Wi-Fi Passwords:** Use a strong password for your home Wi-Fi network.\n\n**5. Virtual Private Network (VPN):**\n\n* **Consider a VPN:** A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, making it more secure, especially when using public Wi-Fi.\n\n**6. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**\n\n* **Enable 2FA:** Whenever possible, enable two-factor authentication for your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* **Digital Literacy Classes:** I can help you find free digital literacy classes at our library. These classes cover topics like online safety, privacy, and cybersecurity.\n* **Online Privacy Guides:** The library has online resources and guides on protecting your privacy online.\n\nRemember, protecting your privacy is an ongoing process. Stay informed about online threats and best practices.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.",

    "response": "Hi James,\n\nIt's great that you're thinking about online privacy! It's super important in today's world.  \n\nLet's break down some ways to protect your privacy online. \n\n**1. Strong Passwords & Passphrase:**\n\n* **Unique Passwords:**  Use a different password for every online account (email, social media, banking, etc.). It's a pain, but it's the best way to keep things secure. \n* **Passphrase Power:** Instead of remembering complex passwords, try a passphrase – a string of unrelated words that are easy for you to remember but hard for others to guess (e.g., \"PurpleElephantSingsJazz\").\n\n**2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**\n\n* **Extra Layer:**  This adds an extra layer of security. When you log in, you'll need a code from your phone in addition to your password. Most major websites and apps offer this.\n\n**3. Be Careful What You Share:**\n\n* **Think Before You Post:**  Avoid sharing personal information online that you wouldn't want public (full address, phone number, birthdate, etc.).\n* **Privacy Settings:**  Review the privacy settings on your social media accounts and adjust them to limit who can see your posts and information.\n\n**4. Beware of Phishing:**\n\n* **Suspicious Emails & Links:** Don't click on links in emails from unknown senders, and be wary of requests for personal information. \n* **Hover Over Links:** Before clicking, hover your mouse over the link to see the actual URL. If it looks suspicious, don't click.\n\n**5. Secure Wi-Fi:**\n\n* **Public Wi-Fi Caution:**  Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities (banking, shopping) as it's less secure.\n* **VPN (Virtual Private Network):**  A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, making it harder for others to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi.\n\n**6. Browser & Software Updates:**\n\n* **Stay Updated:**  Keep your web browser, operating system, and software up to date. These updates often include security patches.\n\n**7. Anti-Virus & Firewall:**\n\n* **Protection:** Install reputable anti-virus software and make sure your firewall is turned on to protect your device from malware and hackers.\n\n**Library Resources:**\n\n* **Free Wi-Fi:** We have free, secure Wi-Fi here at the library.\n* **Computer Classes:** We offer classes on digital literacy, including online safety and privacy.\n* **Databases & eBooks:**  We have online databases and eBooks that can provide more in-depth information on online privacy.\n\nRemember, protecting your privacy online is an ongoing process. Be aware of the risks, take steps to protect yourself, and stay informed about new threats and best practices.\n\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any more questions. I'm here to help!",
